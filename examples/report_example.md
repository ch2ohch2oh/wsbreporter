Dear Degenerates and Future Inhabitants of the Wendy’s Parking Lot,

We head into the first week of February with the visual clarity of a cataract patient in a fog bank. Our proprietary research team (a collection of highly regarded individuals scrolling through Reddit while their wife’s boyfriends make dinner) has noted that the official earnings graphics have become [unbearably ugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mpypy/) and are currently being broadcast in [stunning 280p resolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qd0ee/). While we can [barely read the names](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qd0ee/) on the calendar, the smell of desperation is high-definition. Some of you are screaming that it’s [puts season](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mtbca/) because [earnings don’t mean shit anymore](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mx4j0/), while others are preparing to light their portfolios on fire for a "sexy week."

**RDDT:** Despite many of our analysts having their [asses burned](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qtoqc/) by this ticker over the last month, the consensus is to [go in deep](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qtoqc/) for the earnings report. The logic is simple: if we buy enough subscriptions, we can [send it to the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2r42m1/). Expecting a return to [$200 next week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2ocpoc/), our fund is officially going [full port](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2svqu8/) and praying the platform [saves our portfolios](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2omjca/).

**GOOGL:** We are ignoring all fundamental data and moving [all in](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2moklq/) on Google. The quant desk (a guy named Gary) is screaming for [330C contracts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mp0c5/). It's a bold strategy for a company that most of you only use to search "how to file for bankruptcy" and "Wendy's applications."

**PLTR:** Palantir has been down 25% in three months, which, in our highly sophisticated model, means the [sentiment is shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mvpcu/). In the upside-down world of degenerate gambling, this clearly indicates it’s [time to moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mvpcu/). We’re [bullish on the chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2oeuoj/) purely because everyone else is crying.

**SMCI:** This ticker remains the ultimate Rorschach test for the financially illiterate. While some of our associates have secured [4 calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mplbq/), others are correctly identifying it as [literally the worst company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2o210c/). We expect nothing but pure, unadulterated loss porn regardless of the direction.

**AMD:** The directive here is clear and concise: [250C and fucking send it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mp0c5/). We don't need chips where we're going—mostly because where we're going is a cardboard box under an overpass.

**AMZN:** Investors are currently [scared and confused](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2osxb4/) about how to play Amazon earnings. When in doubt, Hindsight Capital recommends doing what the most successful traders do: ask a stranger on the internet for their [play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2osxb4/) and then do the exact opposite five minutes after the IV crush destroys your premiums.

If you’re worried about your portfolio, just remember that [can’t-read-the-pixels graphics](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2n1ash/) are a leading indicator of a market top. Or a market bottom. Honestly, we just like the colors. Put on your diamond hands, prepare your paper hearts, and we'll see you in the bread line on Monday.

May your gains be as high-res as the [earnings threads used to be](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2n3mfc/),
