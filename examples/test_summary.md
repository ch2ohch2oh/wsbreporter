Ladies, Gentlemen, and those of you currently living in your wife’s boyfriend’s basement:

It’s been a weekend of historic proportions, and by "historic," I mean we’ve managed to turn the global commodities market into a [pump dot fun token](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2obayd/). While the "intelligent" money was busy analyzing spreadsheets, the sub has been watching the global economy turn into a [Jenga tower](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxzbb/). Below are the tickers currently fueling the hopium and the heartbreak.

### **The Trending Tickers**

**[SLV/GLD]:** Precious metals investors learned the hard way that [exit liquidity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2njb1d/) is a universal concept after silver suffered its largest single-day drop in history. With the CME [hiking margins](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2t1jui/) and rumors of [collapsing gold platforms](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs651t/gold_trading_platform_of_collapsing_after_users/o2t38b5/) in China, the consensus is that [paper gold](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs651t/gold_trading_platform_of_collapsing_after_users/o2t7wfm/) bulls are officially "warshed."

**[ORCL]:** Oracle is apparently preparing to [liquidate the business](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2q3iux/) to fund its OpenAI obsession, with plans to cut 30,000 jobs and dump Cerner at a loss. While bears scream about [massive debt and bankruptcy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxy48/), the WSB bulls are predictably predicting a [rally due to lower operating costs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pybc8/).

**[RDDT]:** Ahead of earnings, the bulls are doubling down on expectations of [continued user growth](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2ocpoc/) pushing the stock back to the $200 mark. Despite many users [getting burned last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qtoqc/), the prevailing strategy is to ignore the "puts season" sentiment and [fucking send it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mp0c5/).

**[NVDA]:** Jensen Huang has reportedly put the [$100 billion megadeal](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrmhs9/the_100_billion_megadeal_between_openai_and/o2p9w0w/) with OpenAI on ice, citing a distinct [lack of discipline](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrmhs9/the_100_billion_megadeal_between_openai_and/o2pg1fu/) in their business approach. Investors are worried the AI bubble is finally showing cracks as the [circle jerking](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrmhs9/the_100_billion_megadeal_between_openai_and/o2pa7dk/) between chip makers and software giants begins to fracture.

**[MSFT]:** Microsoft is being mocked as a [cow chained to OpenAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs6581/open_ai_everyday/o2t3tb9/), with its stock getting crushed as the [chatbot hype is cooling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrmhs9/the_100_billion_megadeal_between_openai_and/o2psrku/). Some users are even calling for the [destruction of OpenAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs6581/open_ai_everyday/o2t6uy3/) to save the rest of the tech portfolios currently in shambles.

**[PLTR]:** Sentiment has officially hit rock bottom after the stock dropped [25% in three months](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mvpcu/), which, in WSB logic, means it's [time to moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mvpcu/). While some are calling for puts, the contrarians are betting that [sentiment being shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mvpcu/) is the only technical indicator they need for a rally.

**[GOOGL]:** Amidst the OpenAI drama, Google is seeing a surge in "smart money" sentiment because Sundar Pichai built a [vertically integrated stack](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrmhs9/the_100_billion_megadeal_between_openai_and/o2pcf8w/) financed by actual cash flow. Users are increasingly rotating into [GOOGL calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrmhs9/the_100_billion_megadeal_between_openai_and/o2pto90/) as they bet on the "unbreakable" alliance between Nvidia and OpenAI falling apart.

***

In conclusion, if you lost your life savings on leveraged silver ETFs this weekend, just remember: you only [lost three weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrya39/sorry_i_crashed_the_silver_market/o2s6vrr/) of gains, not three years. Get back in there and find a new horse to bet on.
