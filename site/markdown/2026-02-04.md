Fellow Exit Liquidity Providers,

I hope you’ve already applied your [lube](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvmpdy/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_04_2026/o3iljo9/), because the market is currently taking us for a ride we didn't consent to. Between [private payrolls missing](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvox0c/private_payroll_growth_in_january_misses/o3j1fkq/) and the "bad news is good news" rate cut cope, the vibe is pure [despair](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvox0c/private_payroll_growth_in_january_misses/o3jchb8/). Most of you are watching your [YTD gains evaporate](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvt46g/there_go_all_my_ytd_gains/o3jyfnr/) while fund managers are apparently [leveraged to the tits](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quoib6/fund_managers_are_holding_the_lowest_cash_levels/o3cfq2l/) with 3% cash on hand. It’s the perfect time for a [rugpull](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quoib6/fund_managers_are_holding_the_lowest_cash_levels/o3bjbhd/), but hey, at least the [government shutdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qv1gke/us_house_passes_government_funding_bill_to_end/o3e8exl/) is over so we can keep paying taxes on our losses.

**AMD:** Appropriately rebranded as the [Advanced Money Destroyer](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o3ey31n/), the stock [beat earnings and tanked 8%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o3fudhp/) anyway. While most of the sub is [crying in the casino](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvmpdy/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_04_2026/o3iqhiw/), one [absolute legend](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvtu5n/advanced_money_device/o3k45fu/) printed $400k on puts in a single day.

**SNDK:** The peak of 2026 degeneracy. We have "investors" [borrowing against their house](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvoudj/got_home_loan_for_sndk_onds/o3j0vg9/) to sell ITM puts and others dropping [$100k on calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvtxnq/100000_in_sndk_calls/o3k4x9x/) because the [market cap seems reasonable](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvtxnq/100000_in_sndk_calls/o3k4x9x/) if you pretend it’s a $60 stock. 

**LLY:** Eli Lilly is the only thing keeping the lights on. [Strong demand for weight-loss drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvmtx9/eli_lilly_7_premarket_after_754_eps_vs_667_and/) has bulls certain that [Americans being lazy fucks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvmpdy/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_04_2026/o3iziza/) is a bulletproof investment thesis. 

**PYPL:** Currently being [clobbered](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quqlwo/paypal_shares_clobbered_in_premarket_wow/o3bwxjt/) after missing EPS. Sentiment is that it’s the [next Sears or Yahoo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quqlwo/paypal_shares_clobbered_in_premarket_wow/o3c3kpz/), squandering its legacy while [Nancy Pelosi apparently dumped](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quqlwo/paypal_shares_clobbered_in_premarket_wow/o3bzezp/) her bags.

**RDDT:** A rare bright spot. Bulls think it’s going [to the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2r42m1/) because of user growth, though some are [scared to check their portfolios](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2omjca/) after it dropped [40% in two weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvmpdy/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_04_2026/o3jby0l/).

**CMG:** Sinking because [people don’t want to pay $12 for 2 ounces of chicken](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qv5en5/chipotle_stock_sinks_as_restaurant_chain_reports/o3f4q1n/). The [stores are filthy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qv5en5/chipotle_stock_sinks_as_restaurant_chain_reports/o3flwqr/) and the portions are "shiesty," but [Cramer said it might bounce](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o3dmad6/), so obviously, it’s going to zero.

**MSTR:** A [levered ETF Ponzi](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvw6ki/hold_on_for_dear_life/o3ks0pj/) according to the bears. Bagholders are [holding for dear life](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvw6ki/hold_on_for_dear_life/o3km8bh/) while rumors of [Saylor fleeing the country](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2zh40m/) circulate.

**SNAP:** Bears argue the company [converts attention into expenses paid with stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvuwrd/snap_going_down/o3kcdcn/). It’s a [mediocre chat app for middle schoolers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvuwrd/snap_going_down/o3kjye2/) that consumes $1B in stock-based comp to stay afloat.

**GOOGL:** High anxiety. If [Google goes down after earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o3jxgwp/), the consensus is that we are all truly "fucked for good."

**NVDA:** Moving the market with a [$20B OpenAI bet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvqq8h/ai_fear_hitting_software_but_nvda_just_dropped_a/). Some worry about the [rugpull of the century](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvqq8h/ai_fear_hitting_software_but_nvda_just_dropped_a/o3jlzj1/) if AI slop dies, while others are just [buying more calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvqq8h/ai_fear_hitting_software_but_nvda_just_dropped_a/o3jic60/).

**NVO:** Down 14% because [Novo risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qv12cu/novo_nordisk_14_after_forecasting_a_5_to_13_sales/o3f46wj/) is real. They’re getting eaten by Eli Lilly, leaving [bagholders numb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qv12cu/novo_nordisk_14_after_forecasting_a_5_to_13_sales/o3elqj4/) and headed back to the [dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qv12cu/novo_nordisk_14_after_forecasting_a_5_to_13_sales/o3fyxs3/).

**INTC:** The CEO [hired an executive to make GPUs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qv01e0/intel_ceo_says_company_will_make_gpus_has_hired/o3dz3ub/), seemingly forgetting that [they already make them](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qv01e0/intel_ceo_says_company_will_make_gpus_has_hired/o3e1rbf/). Nana is [proud but confused](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qv01e0/intel_ceo_says_company_will_make_gpus_has_hired/o3dxbc5/).

**PLTR:** As usual, everyone expects it to pump while others [buy puts for a guaranteed win](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o381obg/) against their own track record. It remains an [overvalued piece of shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o36s7l0/) depending on who you ask.

**UBER:** Down for no reason, even the [CEO doesn't know why](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvmpdy/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_04_2026/o3ilzyf/). We suggest booking a [2,750-mile trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvmpdy/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_04_2026/o3ilksx/) on the company card to save the stock.

**SPY:** Just a [casually miserable Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvmpdy/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_04_2026/o3juvaa/). If you’re only [down $17k](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvmpdy/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_04_2026/o3jweaq/), treat yourself to double chicken at lunch—you've earned it by not being the guy with the [$40k truck and no gains](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qux824/finally_hit_1k_at_21_years_old_dm_me_for/o3dbbp3/).

If you're looking for a sign to stop, [this isn't it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qux824/finally_hit_1k_at_21_years_old_dm_me_for/o3dqlg7/). Close the app, go [camping in the snow](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvmpdy/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_04_2026/o3ilrr9/), and wait for 2027 to bail us out.

Stay regarded,
