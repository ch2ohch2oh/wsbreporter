My fellow exit-liquidity providers,

The market is currently a [hallucination](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5ptvm/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_16_2026/o5kntx7/) fueled by [cooked books](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3paba/consumer_prices_rose_24_annually_in_january_less/o55tvpq/) and hopium. While the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5pdcs/us_2025_jobs_numbers_revised_down_by_over_1/o569z5b/) admits they were off by a [million jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5pdcs/us_2025_jobs_numbers_revised_down_by_over_1/o5kim62/), the Dow is [over 50,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5pdcs/us_2025_jobs_numbers_revised_down_by_over_1/o5kk28j/) and everyone is [feeling kangarooish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3paba/consumer_prices_rose_24_annually_in_january_less/o55vs5x/). Tomorrow the [casino is closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5ptvm/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_16_2026/o5kmqm6/), so you have 24 hours to [stare at your wall](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5ptvm/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_16_2026/o5knlk7/) and pretend your net worth isn't a [rounding error](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5pdcs/us_2025_jobs_numbers_revised_down_by_over_1/o5kl6um/).

**[NVDA]:** One absolute unit is betting his [entire existence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4xvec/nvda_earnings_play/o5exhyo/) on the "CapEx Supercycle," claiming the AI bubble is a myth because the stock is at a [historical discount](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4xvec/nvda_earnings_play/). He’s either buying a [GT3RS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4xvec/nvda_earnings_play/) or applying to [Wendy’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4xvec/nvda_earnings_play/) by the 26th.

**[CVNA]:** It’s [puts season](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o58gx7p/) for the used-car vending machine. Sentiment is a [coin flip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o5fmp8u/) between a moon mission and total [implosion](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o59a451/). One hero is doing his part to tank the stock by selling them his [rust bucket WRX](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o57wguf/).

**[GOOGL]:** Apparently, Google is [always red in February](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4y0m9/alphabet_always_red_in_february/). While some have a [thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40hto/my_thesis_was_that_googl_will_dip_below_300_to/o58j2zh/) it dips to $285, others are just [inversing the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4y0m9/alphabet_always_red_in_february/o5f05cm/) because seasonal patterns are for [people with spreadsheets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4y0m9/alphabet_always_red_in_february/o5iq7w1/).

**[WMT]:** The "boomer defensive" play is behaving like a [tech stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o59h2in/). Regards expect a [2% revenue beat](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o5dave0/) to launch it 20% higher because [valuation logic](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o59h2in/) died in 2021.

**[WEN]:** The literal mothership is in [shambles](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/). Rumors of store closures have us panicked about our [dumpster real estate](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/o58no5x/). This is the [ultimate recession indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/o58moww/); if the Frosty machine breaks, it’s [over](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/o59axcn/).

**[PARA/WBD/NFLX]:** A Hollywood three-way of [desperation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5p75k/warner_bros_reconsiders_paramount_108b_sale_after/o5khl0s/). Paramount is trying to buy WBD and offering to pay the [breakup fee](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5p75k/warner_bros_reconsiders_paramount_108b_sale_after/o5kim5o/) to Netflix. It's a [curse cycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5p75k/warner_bros_reconsiders_paramount_108b_sale_after/o5km2cf/) where everyone ends up with [debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5p75k/warner_bros_reconsiders_paramount_108b_sale_after/o5kjoy8/) and nobody has content.

**[AMZN]:** Currently on a [9-day losing streak](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58da4y/). One guy [nuked his port](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58bl8n/) praying for an [8% pop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35env/if_amzn_goes_up_8_tomorrow_this_will_be_worth_1/). He is officially [cooked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35env/if_amzn_goes_up_8_tomorrow_this_will_be_worth_1/o56jtw6/), proving that [rage buying](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35env/if_amzn_goes_up_8_tomorrow_this_will_be_worth_1/) is the fastest way to the poor house.

**[SLV]:** The [Tampening](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r41vb4/slv_options_after_a_drop_of_30_in_a_day/o58rf98/) has returned. One user lost an [S-Class Mercedes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r41vb4/slv_options_after_a_drop_of_30_in_a_day/) in a single day. Another [capitulated at the top](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4ndxq/regard_loses_45k_trying_to_short_silver/) because [timing is a hell of a drug](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4ndxq/regard_loses_45k_trying_to_short_silver/o5ddy2q/).

**[HOOD]:** A genius bought the top at [$90](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4753g/robbing_hood/) and is now [down $155k](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4753g/robbing_hood/). He's begging you to keep [gambling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4753g/robbing_hood/) so he can move from [living in the hood](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4753g/robbing_hood/o59sdjz/) back to trading it.

**[VKTX]:** The weight-loss play is back. The [pie is enormous](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4opul/vktx_is_vk2735_the_next_glp1_candidate_in_a_phase/o5docj2/) because everyone is [spherical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4opul/vktx_is_vk2735_the_next_glp1_candidate_in_a_phase/o5docj2/). We’re betting on the [fatty liver treatment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4opul/vktx_is_vk2735_the_next_glp1_candidate_in_a_phase/o5czkm2/) because biotech is [easy money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4opul/vktx_is_vk2735_the_next_glp1_candidate_in_a_phase/o5czwpe/) until it isn't.

**[ABXX]:** A [nerd](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4n9hs/abaxx_technologies_real_time_collateral_of_real/o5dgans/) wrote a manifesto about [digital titles](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4n9hs/abaxx_technologies_real_time_collateral_of_real/) and [commodities](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4n9hs/abaxx_technologies_real_time_collateral_of_real/). It’s basically [pure retardium](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3jkk2/at_last_weve_found_it_pure_retardium/o54sceh/), but the upside is [asymmetric](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4n9hs/abaxx_technologies_real_time_collateral_of_real/o5dkr8s/) enough to make us forget we don't understand the tech.

Enjoy your three days of [dark depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58huv4/) while the markets are closed. Just remember: the only difference between gambling and trading is [which narrative](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5t4n8/the_difference_between_gambling_and_trading_is/) lets you sleep at night. 

Stay solvent (somehow),
