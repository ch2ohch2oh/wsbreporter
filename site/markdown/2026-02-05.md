Hindsight Global Regards,

If you’re reading this, you haven’t yet [passed away](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwjfsb/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_05_2026/o3pvtv8/) due to financial reasons. Congratulations. The general market mood is what I like to call "Absolute Cinema," which is to say, a [train wreck](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvywen/welcome_to_2026/o3lf5gy/) where everyone is [eating sleep for dinner](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwjfsb/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_05_2026/o3pifq0/). Between tech giants reporting [schitzo earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qw0zsh/google_googl_reported_earnings/o3lphq1/) and private payrolls showing that only [DoorDash drivers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvox0c/private_payroll_growth_in_january_misses/o3kb81n/) are being hired, we are witnessing the [largest financial crime](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qvywen/welcome_to_2026/o3lmjsu/) in human history. Grab your [guacamole](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qw0q62/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_05_2026/o3mer74/), it’s about to get brown.

**[GOOGL]:** Alphabet posted a massive beat, but the market [dumped it like a rock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qw0zsh/google_googl_reported_earnings/o3locml/) because they’re spending $180B on [Capex stored in the balls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qw0q62/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_05_2026/o3lxu1p/). Sundar basically [laid his cock on the table](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qw0q62/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_05_2026/o3lwy4y/) and the algos still [farted on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qw0zsh/google_googl_reported_earnings/o3lox12/).

**[RDDT]:** Currently in a [unmitigated free fall](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qw5qs2/rddt_down_from_260_to_150_in_past_2_to_3_weeks/o3n1nkd/), but the bulls are screaming [oversold](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o3m28dh/). Some are betting on a [biblical pump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qw5qs2/rddt_down_from_260_to_150_in_past_2_to_3_weeks/o3n1nkd/) while others claim the [AI people realized our posts are worthless](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qw5qs2/rddt_down_from_260_to_150_in_past_2_to_3_weeks/o3n9x55/).

**[SpaceX]:** Elon is aiming for a $1.5T valuation so he can become the [world's first trillionaire](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwbj18/the_spacex_ipo_is_going_to_tank_the_market/o3o8b4r/). The bull case is "[datacenters in space](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwbj18/the_spacex_ipo_is_going_to_tank_the_market/o3nwsx7/)," which critics call a "[shitducken](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwbj18/the_spacex_ipo_is_going_to_tank_the_market/o3o6839/)" designed to [incinerate retirement funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwbj18/the_spacex_ipo_is_going_to_tank_the_market/o3ny2dt/).

**[SNAP]:** This platform is gifting [generational debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qw0q62/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_05_2026/o3mfbd2/) to anyone bullish. Money [disappears like their messages](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwojgu/oh_snap/o3qla3i/), mostly because the CEO makes decisions based on his [wife's vibes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwojgu/oh_snap/o3qp7kh/).

**[AMZN]:** One total legend [full ported $320K into calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwqd9a/full_port_amzn_calls_320k/o3qrv1m/). He’s either getting a [mansion on Epstein’s island](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwqd9a/full_port_amzn_calls_320k/o3qxug5/) or reporting to [Wendy's at 7 AM](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwqd9a/full_port_amzn_calls_320k/o3qsf18/).

**[MSTR]:** Michael Saylor is allegedly [fleeing the country](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2zh40m/) as Bitcoin bros [buy the dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwjfsb/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_05_2026/o3pf8jm/) at $69k just to sell at $42k. It's a [schadenfreude](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwpf7i/mstr_puts/o3qqnk7/) festival for the put-holders.

**[HOOD]:** From skyrocketing to $155 to [living in the hood](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwdxsn/are_we_cooked_100k/o3ockb8/). Investors are [bleeding out](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwdxsn/are_we_cooked_100k/o3obeju/) but still praying for [retard strength](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwdxsn/are_we_cooked_100k/o3q4mj1/) and a [Trump prediction market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwdxsn/are_we_cooked_100k/o3obeju/) rally.

**[AMD]:** The "[Advanced Money Destroyer](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o3ey31n/)" lived up to its name, [beating earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o3fudhp/) and crashing 8%. It’s a [joke market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o3ex6py/) for anybody not trading against themselves.

**[SLV]:** Silver is a [volatile mess](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwoju5/slv_puts/o3qzyn9/) of [bankster manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwoju5/slv_puts/o3qefts/). One regard bought a Google call with his [leftover SLV money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwoju5/slv_puts/o3qequp/) and confirmed that today is officially a bad day.

**[HIMS]:** Betting on the "[boner pills moat](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwhiyu/hims_ready_for_a_rerating_option_play/o3pzudp/)." While some are [shorting the baldness](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwhiyu/hims_ready_for_a_rerating_option_play/o3p2ixl/), others believe prevention is the new [Great Healthcare Plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwhiyu/hims_ready_for_a_rerating_option_play/o3oyvsf/).

**[NIO]:** Finally [profitable](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwilws/nio_announces_first_profitable_quarter/o3p5s3p/), but the bagholders who bought at $50 are still [down 98%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwilws/nio_announces_first_profitable_quarter/o3pzcr4/). Conviction never withered, but [retirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwilws/nio_announces_first_profitable_quarter/o3p8e9q/) certainly did.

**[ASTS]:** Speculation is mounting that the iPhone 17 will feature [ass to mouth](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwa213/apple_seems_to_be_testing_the_iphone_17_with/o3o151j/)—sorry, *ass to satellites*—connectivity. Some wish they hadn’t blown their [asstits money on a cruise](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwa213/apple_seems_to_be_testing_the_iphone_17_with/o3nq0sm/).

Remember, if you feel bad, there’s a [crypto bro right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwjfsb/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_05_2026/o3ppmmb/) asking ChatGPT to write a poem about how Bitcoin will rise from the ashes. It won’t. Go find a [tortilla with the image of Jesus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwjfsb/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_05_2026/o3pipiu/) to use as currency.

Withdrawing my remaining $783 in buying power,
