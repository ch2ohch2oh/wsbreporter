Dearly Regarded,

Welcome to the most productive day of your year, mainly because the New York casino is shuttered for a holiday and you haven't been able to incinerate your life savings on 0DTEs for the last 72 hours. While the rest of the world celebrates "Presidents' Day," our community is huddled together like [fentanyl zombies and crack addicts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r67u06/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_16_2026/o5oxsim/) on the streets of LA, twitching for a single tick of green. The vibe is one of pure withdrawal; investors are so desperate they’re actually [reading books](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r67u06/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_16_2026/o5ob32d/) or—heaven forbid—[staring at their bedroom walls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5ptvm/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_16_2026/o5knlk7/) for 14 hours. Meanwhile, the government admitted they [burned the whole kitchen](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5pdcs/us_2025_jobs_numbers_revised_down_by_over_1/o5ki8zc/) by revising 2025 job numbers down by a cool million, proving that our [leaders might actually have cognitive disabilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5pdcs/us_2025_jobs_numbers_revised_down_by_over_1/o5lan08/). 

Here is the damage for the day:

**[NVDA]:** Jensen’s hype train is currently a "forward-looking discounting machine" trading at a [historical discount](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4xvec/nvda_earnings_play/o5exhyo/) compared to Walmart. While the bears scream about a bubble, the hyperscalers are locked into a [$680 billion CapEx supercycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4xvec/nvda_earnings_play/o5exhyo/). If earnings moon on February 26, our lead analyst is either [ordering a GT3RS or applying at Wendy’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4xvec/nvda_earnings_play/o5exhyo/). Of course, we’re all just waiting to see what Nancy Pelosi does with her [heavy hangers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6lrs0/im_in_love_with_nancy_pelosi/o5r9ide/).

**[ZIM]:** Pure [insider AF](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69zr6/zim_play_and_i_didnt_even_know_about_the_buyout/o5pe5l2/). Some "lucky" regard bought calls on Friday only to wake up to a [German market gap-up of 25%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69zr6/zim_play_and_i_didnt_even_know_about_the_buyout/o5ojqnh/) due to a Hapag-Lloyd buyout rumor. It’s better to be [lucky than smart](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69zr6/zim_play_and_i_didnt_even_know_about_the_buyout/o5okxle/) when you’re committing straight-up robbery while the casino is closed.

**[WEN]:** The ultimate recession indicator. Wendy’s is closing hundreds of stores because the [4 for $4 is a lie](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/o58r48z/) and the [lettuce is now shredded garbage](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/o58ykay/). Investors are terrified of being [evicted from the dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/o58nsh0/), though some hope for a [worker-owned Wendi's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/o58oddo/) where we can trade while flipping patties.

**[SPOT]:** One degenerate is [punting $100k into calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5oggm/need_to_make_last_years_losses_back_punting_100k/o5kaszx/) to "make back last year's losses"—the classic revenge trade that usually ends in [humiliation rituals](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5oggm/need_to_make_last_years_losses_back_punting_100k/o5mjl00/). This, despite Apple preparing to [clap some cheeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6io1o/spotify_is_on_the_spot_now/o5qfa72/) in the podcast game.

**[GOOGL]:** Alphabet is [consistently red in February](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4y0m9/alphabet_always_red_in_february/o5eym1s/), presumably because it’s the shortest month to suffer. Between [Google Genie killing video games](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4mvmx/ailed_software_selloff_may_pose_risk_for_15/o5cw9f7/) and Morgan Stanley being a [bitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4mvmx/ailed_software_selloff_may_pose_risk_for_15/o5cpine/), the "AI is killing AI" narrative is in full swing.

**[WBD]:** The "curse cycle" continues. Warner Bros is reconsidering a sale to Paramount after they offered to cover a [$2.8 billion Netflix breakup fee](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warner-bros-weighs-reopening-sale-195058251.html). Netflix should just [take the check and run](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5p75k/warner_bros_reconsiders_paramount_108b_sale_after/o5lqpvt/) while Paramount collapses under a [house of cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5p75k/warner_bros_reconsiders_paramount_108b_sale_after/o5lnfq2/).

**[SNDK]:** HDD capacity is [100% sold out for 2026](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69rqb/western_digital_says_2026_hdd_capacity_100_sold/o5ohxtt/). Hyperscalers are gobbling up everything, meaning the only way to store data in the future will be on [stone tablets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69rqb/western_digital_says_2026_hdd_capacity_100_sold/o5qdvhf/) or by scavenging [500GB platters from your 2010 PC](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69rqb/western_digital_says_2026_hdd_capacity_100_sold/o5otu1i/).

**[IONQ]:** Quantum computing: a [hoax wrapped in dogshit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r61r8w/what_is_wsb_take_on_quantum_is_this_a_playable/o5of99u/). It’s either the next internet or a [long scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r61r8w/what_is_wsb_take_on_quantum_is_this_a_playable/o5o9dc1/). Either way, we're all in for [quantum sex](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r61r8w/what_is_wsb_take_on_quantum_is_this_a_playable/o5n1938/) before any of these companies become profitable.

**[PLTR]:** Michael Burry is [shorting Alex Karp](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6lptj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_17_2026/o5rvy2f/) again. Apparently, he was found in an NYC street covered in piss, which Karp claims had nothing to do with [fentanyl-laced piss drones](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6lptj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_17_2026/o5rvy2f/). 

**[MSFT]:** One absolute madman [risked $2k for a $300 gain](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4w5b1/from_2k_to_300_msft_odte_calls/o5jgi3l/) on 0DTEs. It’s [generational wealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4w5b1/from_2k_to_300_msft_odte_calls/o5j9ubi/) for ants.

**[ANTH]:** The Pentagon is threatening to label Anthropic a [supply chain risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6iyqd/pentagon_threatens_to_label_anthropic_ai_a_supply/o5qgnpg/) because they won't let the government [genocide even a little bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6iyqd/pentagon_threatens_to_label_anthropic_ai_a_supply/o5qi0mv/). Meanwhile, Elon is probably making a [phone call to Donnie](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6iyqd/pentagon_threatens_to_label_anthropic_ai_a_supply/o5qlb26/) to ensure Grok wins the drone wars.

**[SLV]:** Silver is getting [lobotomized live](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5ptvm/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_16_2026/o5l9clr/). We have regards losing $45k by [capitulating at the top](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4ndxq/regard_loses_45k_trying_to_short_silver/o5cofp2/), proving that the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay [solvent](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4ndxq/regard_loses_45k_trying_to_short_silver/o5ex863/).

**[TSLA]:** A random [+6% day is coming Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5pdcs/us_2025_jobs_numbers_revised_down_by_over_1/o5kijwa/) for no reason. In other news, the [Cybertruck is a loneliness machine](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5ptvm/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_16_2026/o5m2a69/) and we’re all waiting for Musk’s [sexbots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5ptvm/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_16_2026/o5klum0/) so we can get remotely fucked by a man in India.

In conclusion, if you ever think about giving up, [stop it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6lptj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_17_2026/o5r4il8/). All it takes is one 40-bagger to break even after five years in the trenches. 

Stay frosty, and remember: if the 10-year yield moves 0.1%, it’s time to [flip your shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6lptj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_17_2026/o5rqzlc/).
