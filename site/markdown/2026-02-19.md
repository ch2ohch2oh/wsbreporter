Hindsight Global Investors and Future Wendy’s Associates,

The market vibe today is a intoxicating cocktail of geopolitical anxiety, earnings-induced suicide watches, and the kind of [weaponized autism](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9b6et/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2026/o6bg66o/) that keeps this firm in business. While some of you are checking the [Pentagon pizza orders](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9b6et/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2026/o6bvzy2/) three times a day to time the next Iranian conflict, the rest of are just trying to figure out why our [passive investments outpace our retarded trades](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9b6et/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2026/o6b52c7/) by 500%. It’s a classic combo day—OPEX, GDP, and PCE—meaning tomorrow is either a [green dildo to the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9ccbe/looking_at_my_portfolio_friday_opex_gdp_pce/o6be4e0/) or we’re all moving into a [shared dumpster behind the local Mickey D's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r92c68/how_can_i_make_it_back/o6997x6/).

**[CVNA]:** The ultimate [scam company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o64jfim/) continues to defy the laws of physics and fiscal sanity. Bears are screaming about [subprime auto loan delinquencies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8okwx/riding_cvna_to_0/o66yng6/) and [insider selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8okwx/riding_cvna_to_0/o66yng6/), but the stock keeps [rebounding from -24% deaths](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8okwx/riding_cvna_to_0/o68w15b/) just to liquidate put holders. It’s a [nonsensical stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8okwx/riding_cvna_to_0/o66mpmo/) that can stay [regarded longer than you can stay solvent](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8okwx/riding_cvna_to_0/o6aeo18/).

**[WMT]:** America’s favorite retailer [beat earnings by a penny](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8z3v6/walmart_3_premarket_after_q4_earnings_eps_074_vs/o68tuo6/) and then tanked on [weak-ass guidance](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8z3v6/walmart_3_premarket_after_q4_earnings_eps_074_vs/o68tuo6/). Trading at a [PE of 44](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8z3v6/walmart_3_premarket_after_q4_earnings_eps_074_vs/o68pdpl/), it’s apparently a bigger [bubble than AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8z3v6/walmart_3_premarket_after_q4_earnings_eps_074_vs/o68ozxf/). If this "safe haven" life raft sinks, [we’re all fucked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8z3v6/walmart_3_premarket_after_q4_earnings_eps_074_vs/o68kjeo/).

**[KLAR]:** Klarna is the only company where [increased revenue is actually a risk metric](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r97tdm/klarna_beats_all_metrics_sees_38_revenue_growth/o6agz3i/). Despite the revenue growth, they’re [swinging to losses](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r97tdm/klarna_beats_all_metrics_sees_38_revenue_growth/o6akmk6/) and watching the stock collapse like a [Buy Now, Pay Later house of cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r97tdm/klarna_beats_all_metrics_sees_38_revenue_growth/o6ao9rs/). Apparently, people [financing their McDonald’s trips](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r97tdm/klarna_beats_all_metrics_sees_38_revenue_growth/o6agptp/) isn't a sustainable business model.

**[PLTR]:** The darling of the [war-hawks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9bhll/my_iranian_war_play/o6b635e/). Whether you [hate the stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8jyc5/betting_on_btc_to_crash_by_end_of_week/o65lj69/) or you’re [straddling it for 10-baggers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8cnc0/finally_took_profit_on_a_10bagger/o63xbuj/), it’s the primary play for the "Iranian War Special." Just don't ask if they [actually make missiles](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9bhll/my_iranian_war_play/o6bd3bh/).

**[OKLO]:** One bold retard is calling for [$250 by America’s 250th birthday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8yc1i/oklo_round_3_the_path_to_250_for_americas_250th/o68eg6e/). It’s a lot of [ChatGPT-sounding hopium](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8yc1i/oklo_round_3_the_path_to_250_for_americas_250th/o68icwr/) about "Nuclear Campuses," but the [HQ looks like a glorified shed](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8yc1i/oklo_round_3_the_path_to_250_for_americas_250th/o69871z/).

**[BTC/ETH]:** The "digital gold" narrative is [taking a dirt nap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9bhll/my_iranian_war_play/o6b635e/). People are [averaging down on ETH bags](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9dbjz/do_people_still_believe_in_eth_long_term/o6bk5xz/) like they’re [fucking a dead pig](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9dbjz/do_people_still_believe_in_eth_long_term/o6bkejy/). Most are just [vibe trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8jyc5/betting_on_btc_to_crash_by_end_of_week/o65l35v/) their way into 🌽 [crashing sub 60k](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9b6et/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2026/o6bunmv/).

**[OPEN]:** Puts were the move until [shorts got roasted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9b6et/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2026/o6b61g0/). Even [former strippers turned real estate agents](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9b6et/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2026/o6b87ck/) have higher margins than this housing wreck.

**[SLV]:** Greed is a hell of a drug. One regard turned a [$16k gain into an $18k loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9bs3w/slv_puts_capitulation_shouldnt_have_pushed_my_luck/o6b8cqn/) because he thought he could [play Russian roulette with an automatic pistol](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9bs3w/slv_puts_capitulation_shouldnt_have_pushed_my_luck/o6bb1wy/). Now he’s praying to the [metal gods](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9bs3w/slv_puts_capitulation_shouldnt_have_pushed_my_luck/o6bakpc/) for a PCE miracle.

**[PYPL]:** The [meme of value traps](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8sx8r/is_anyone_considering_paypal/o67f44a/). People have been calling it a [generational buy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8sx8r/is_anyone_considering_paypal/o695kbc/) since $300, and it’s been a [golden turd](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8sx8r/is_anyone_considering_paypal/o69hy0a/) ever since. Unless Elon buys it back for the [nostalgia of being a loony billionaire](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8sx8r/is_anyone_considering_paypal/o68z72p/), it’s probably a "fuck no."

**[HTZ]:** A [$40k YOLO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r93cdh/htz_y40k_yolo_final_call_yada_yada_yada/o69g5ez/) based on the idea that they've [cleared their EV depreciation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r93cdh/htz_y40k_yolo_final_call_yada_yada_yada/o69l5r1/) while Avis is still drowning. It’s either a [brilliant turnaround play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r93cdh/htz_y40k_yolo_final_call_yada_yada_yada/o69ich6/) or another [trip to bankruptcy court](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r93cdh/htz_y40k_yolo_final_call_yada_yada_yada/o6a7v8w/).

**[SPY/QQQ]:** [0DTE options are a waste of time](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9b6et/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2026/o6b4nkv/)... until they [print $30k in a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8wo1a/qqq_odtes/o682nta/). We’re just [waiting for SPY to hit 697](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o59jkcl/) for the 4th time so we can [ignore the numbers and just trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8wo1a/qqq_odtes/o682nta/).

If you’re [crying about a 30% loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r92c68/how_can_i_make_it_back/o69cc21/), you’re a pussy; that's just a [tuition payment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r92c68/how_can_i_make_it_back/o69bof8/) in this casino. Real pros [blow up $50k on Robinhood](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8b8di/50k_loss_on_robinhood_145m_cost_basis_cant_wait/o63lzjf/) with a $14.5M cost basis and [hand the disaster to their CPA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r8b8di/50k_loss_on_robinhood_145m_cost_basis_cant_wait/o63lzjf/) like it’s a bag of fries.

May your [god hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9exis/adding_more_money_to_my_account/o6bx4e8/) be filled with tendies,
