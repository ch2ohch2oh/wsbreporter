Fellow Degenerates,

Welcome to another day in the [never-ending casino](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra00b2/weekly_earnings_thread_223_227/o6g3lyz/). While most of you were busy drawing [dinosaurs on your SPY charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra7akv/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o6hq10w/), the market decided to undergo "nuclear whiplash." We had a [bad GDP miss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9vgw4/gdp_miss_badly/), the Supreme Court ruled the "Liberation Day" tariffs illegal, and our Dear Leader immediately doubled down with a [new 10% global tariff](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra3ptw/trump_announces_new_10_global_tariff/) just to keep the [ketchup bottles flying](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9xu7b/supreme_court_rules_that_trumps_sweeping/o6fnqtr/). Naturally, the market went green because [it's all a scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra3ptw/trump_announces_new_10_global_tariff/o6gwxsg/). If you're not confused, you're not paying attention—or you’re just [raw-dogging life](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra7akv/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o6hsudq/) without a brokerage account.

**NVDA:** The [judgment day for humanity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra00b2/weekly_earnings_thread_223_227/o6ggob7/) arrives next Wednesday. The sentiment is pure terror; if Jensen misses, the [entire market is fucked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra00b2/weekly_earnings_thread_223_227/o6gpgt5/). Some regards are betting on a beat and [grinding higher to $200](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra00b2/weekly_earnings_thread_223_227/o6h5p1m/), while others are just watching [Jensen eat video cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra00b2/weekly_earnings_thread_223_227/o6hqcve/) in meme form.

**SPY:** Despite the economy [careening off a path](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9vgw4/gdp_miss_badly/o6fenkx/) and impending war, some of you feel the [700 target in your chode](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra7akv/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o6hqinu/). It turns out bad GDP is actually [bullish af](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9vgw4/gdp_miss_badly/o6f8pdi/) because it might bait a rate cut from the Fed.

**OPEN:** Opendoor managed to rally 16% on a [garage sale quarter](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9nlfc/open_made_just_4000_per_home_last_quarter_every/). They made a pathetic [$4,000 per home](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9nlfc/open_made_just_4000_per_home_last_quarter_every/) while vaporizing a third of shareholder equity to [avoid bankruptcy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9nlfc/open_made_just_4000_per_home_last_quarter_every/). It’s a [meme stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9nlfc/open_made_just_4000_per_home_last_quarter_every/o6fuifp/) propped up by a "Datadoor Discord," proving once again that fundamentals are for people who like losing money slowly.

**CRWD & NET:** These security plays got [misguidingly dumped](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra87of/crwd_and_net_down_almost_10_today_because_claude/) because Anthropic's Claude learned how to review code. Panic-selling these because of an AI code tool is like [removing your seatbelt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra87of/crwd_and_net_down_almost_10_today_because_claude/) because you tightened your wheel nuts. The [algos have zero expertise](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra87of/crwd_and_net_down_almost_10_today_because_claude/o6i7hm7/), and we’re here to buy the dip.

**KLARNA:** The Buy-Now-Pay-Later kingpin [sank to a loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r97tdm/klarna_beats_all_metrics_sees_38_revenue_growth/o6agii1/) because, shockingly, people finance their [trips to McDonald's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r97tdm/klarna_beats_all_metrics_sees_38_revenue_growth/o6agptp/) and don't pay it back. The stock price will surely recover in [four easy interest-free payments](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r97tdm/klarna_beats_all_metrics_sees_38_revenue_growth/o6af12o/).

**ZIM:** One lucky regard actually [nailed the exit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra8han/closed_my_zim_position/) for a $200k bag, thanking [Theta gang for their generosity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra8han/closed_my_zim_position/). It’s nice to see someone win before they inevitably [piss in a microwave](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra8han/closed_my_zim_position/o6i9lsc/).

**MSFT:** Currently has the [lowest weekly RSI since 2006](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra7akv/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o6hsjtx/), and yet it [barely has a pulse](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9tj1h/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_20_2026/o6etdwo/). Apparently, putting [images in Notepad](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra79ew/msft_is_such_crap/o6hs5dj/) isn't the moon catalyst we were promised.

**SOFI:** The [Chamath SPAC curse](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra54ng/7k_down_3k_more_to_go_thank_you_sofi/o6hee2r/) continues to cuck investors. It’s the kind of stock that is nice at first, but then [laughs at you when you’re naked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra54ng/7k_down_3k_more_to_go_thank_you_sofi/o6hix7a/).

**RDDT:** A DoorDash driver is betting his [last $160 on calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9lbib/down_to_my_last_160_what_should_i_do/) to recoup $140k in losses. He claims his [predictions have never been wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9lbib/down_to_my_last_160_what_should_i_do/o6d9qx8/), he’s just "always too early." Welcome home, brother.

**ETH:** Is anyone still [fucking this dead pig](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9dbjz/do_people_still_believe_in_eth_long_term/o6bkejy/)? Most regards have realized it’s a [cyclical grift](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9dbjz/do_people_still_believe_in_eth_long_term/o6bld8q/) and are moving their bags to the [classified goat fucker chronicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r9tj1h/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_20_2026/o6ezkrs/).

**DPZ:** Buffet increased his stake, and some are betting the house because [everyone is still eating pizza](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra00b2/weekly_earnings_thread_223_227/o6h7v7e/). Plus, the [Pentagon just ordered 50 pies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra7akv/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o6hpw3s/), which usually means we’re about to nuke someone. Bullish.

**GOOG:** One degenerate turned $1,600 into $11,000 on 3DTEs, claiming he'd have [made a million dollars](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra812l/i_heard_this_was_the_casino_goog_3dte_1640_11589/o6ia9eg/) if he hadn't bought Microsoft instead. Hindsight is a bitch, isn't it?

**RKLB:** Investors are praying for an update on [Neutron](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra00b2/weekly_earnings_thread_223_227/o6g7wxr/), though most are just [bagholding since the last launch](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra7akv/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o6hwopg/). 

If you're still reading this, you probably have a [stop loss that got sniped](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra80mk/stop_loss_got_sniped/) at the exact bottom. My advice? Stop using them. True men ride their losses [down to fucking zero](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ra80mk/stop_loss_got_sniped/o6icfvn/) like the founders intended. See you at the Wendy's dumpster on Monday.

Stay broke,
