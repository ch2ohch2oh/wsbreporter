Greetings, fellow liquidity providers.

The general market vibe today is what experts call a "total flush." While the boomer indexes pretend everything is fine, the portfolios that actually matter are being [railed](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qx3m84/is_everyone_ok_lol/o3tnav1/) by a week of [Black Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxfqus/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_06_2026/o3vywhk/). We’re currently in a [dead cat bounce](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxfqus/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_06_2026/o3w00to/) where bulls are celebrating a 1% gain after a [30% red week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxfqus/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_06_2026/o3vz47p/). Leverage is the word of the day, as [margin calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qx4m1d/adding_to_the_loss_porn_pile/o3tz47w/) act like a waterfall of tears across the sub. If you don't feel [chest pain](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxfqus/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_06_2026/o3w48dc/) when you open your app, you’re clearly not a client of Hindsight.

**AMZN:** Earnings are out and Jeff’s [dick-swinging contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwxp4w/amazon_earnings_are_out_here_are_the_numbers/o3sfpsb/) involves a [$200 billion CapEx spend](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwxp4w/amazon_earnings_are_out_here_are_the_numbers/o3sj9kq/) that is absolutely [cooking the stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwxp4w/amazon_earnings_are_out_here_are_the_numbers/o3skvir/). 

**SpaceX/xAI:** Elon is proposing a [$1.25 trillion "shitducken"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwbj18/the_spacex_ipo_is_going_to_tank_the_market/o3o6839/) megamerger based on the promise of [datacenters in space](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwbj18/the_spacex_ipo_is_going_to_tank_the_market/o3nygcb/), which sounds a lot like a [Dyson sphere by 2027](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxcj5p/inside_elon_musks_125_trillion_ai_and_space/o3vzkzg/) from a man who [can’t build a train](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxcj5p/inside_elon_musks_125_trillion_ai_and_space/o3vzkzg/). 

**MSTR:** Michael Saylor is sitting on [$8.8 billion in unrealized losses](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwx2z0/mstr_is_sitting_on_an_88_billion_unrealized_loss/o3s8c8e/) and laughing in the [face of his scammed investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxfqus/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_06_2026/o3w5mpd/). 

**BTC:** Officially renamed to [shitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwuo98/getting_flushed/o3rr22b/) by the mob as it [dives toward $60k](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwojgu/oh_snap/o3sre4c/).

**PYPL:** Some hero took out an [$80k loan](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qx2mdl/can_i_file_bankruptcy/o3tdyla/) to bet on calls and is now being advised to [learn how to deepthroat](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qx2mdl/can_i_file_bankruptcy/o3tfyae/) to pay off the debt.

**SNAP:** Regards are betting the farm on an app for [14-year-old girls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwojgu/oh_snap/o3qhiby/) while its [CEO dilutes shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwojgu/oh_snap/o3qp7kh/) to keep his supermodel wife happy.

**IREN:** Reports showed a net income miss of [76.6%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxckl9/iren_reports_q2_fy26_results/o3vdqa6/), proving it was doing well until [someone on WSB discovered it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxckl9/iren_reports_q2_fy26_results/o3vyfpg/).

**MSFT:** Dropping because the market thinks [software is dead](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxjxqe/snapd_my_moonshot_ticket/o3x7dqq/) or because it's [Microslop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qx1wk6/what_stocks_do_you_think_are_at_a_discount_and_a/o3toqtb/).

**GDRX:** The new "TrumpRx" is just a [front for GoodRX](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxgldf/trumprx_is_a_front_for_gdrx_but_nobody_cares/o3w8p6t/) tech, trying to make [drugs stylish again](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxgldf/trumprx_is_a_front_for_gdrx_but_nobody_cares/o3y25rg/).

**QCOM:** One of the few wins this week was a [puts play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxjvgg/qcom_earnings_play/o3wtpn9/) on memory pricing issues. 

**NBIS:** Hailed as the ticker to [save AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xkdgw/), though most think it’s just [garbage](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxckl9/iren_reports_q2_fy26_results/o3wnh75/).

**WEN:** As always, Wendy’s is the [only winner](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xdyso/) of the week, with the [dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qx2mdl/can_i_file_bankruptcy/o3tft44/) welcoming failed traders with open arms.

The trick to current investing is to [be poor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qx3m84/is_everyone_ok_lol/o3trixg/) so you have less to lose. If you’re like our whale who went from [$3M to $1.4M](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxaaov/3m_to_14m_this_week/) in five days, just remember: it's not a loss if you [don't sell](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwuo98/getting_flushed/o3s6cjb/).

Don’t cry in the casino,
