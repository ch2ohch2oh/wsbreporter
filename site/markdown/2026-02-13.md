Salutations, fellow bagholders and future janitors,

The market mood is currently a cocktail of skepticism and pure, unadulterated [retardium](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3jkk2/at_last_weve_found_it_pure_retardium/o54s785/). While the CPI numbers supposedly "cooled," the consensus is that the [books are cooked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3paba/consumer_prices_rose_24_annually_in_january_less/o55tvpq/) to a Michelin-star perfection. We are officially in a [Kangaroo market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3nca3/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_13_2026/o55hovi/), where the "Mag 7" have officially transitioned into the [Bag 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58cw6r/). If you aren’t losing money on [fake days](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58fn8u/) like this, are you even trying?

**[AMZN]:** Jeff Bezos’s midlife crisis is hitting portfolios hard. After a [9-day red streak](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58da4y/), one brave soul bet the farm on an 8% pump that never came and ended up [completely cooked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35env/if_amzn_goes_up_8_tomorrow_this_will_be_worth_1/o56jtw6/). 

**[WEN]:** Panic is hitting the streets as Wendy’s prepares to shutter locations. The real concern isn't the stock; it's the fate of the [dumpsters](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/o58nr1u/), our primary place of business. Apparently, [dynamic closing](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/o58p14c/) is the new dynamic pricing.

**[SLV]:** Silver caught a [falling knife](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r41vb4/slv_options_after_a_drop_of_30_in_a_day/o58k85d/) made of sterling. Investors are measuring their losses in [Mercedes S-Classes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r41vb4/slv_options_after_a_drop_of_30_in_a_day/o58is6p/) while others are [betting against it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2y87f/16k_gain_on_slv_puts_in_30_minutes/o508i75/) for a quick $16k gain.

**[CVNA]:** Sentiment is split between calling it a [trash company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o57ow5q/) and suburban dads making 7x returns on [put spreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r41xmk/too_scared_to_yolo_naked_puts_settled_for_175k/o58jay1/) because of "testicular fortitude."

**[SPY]:** The [0DTE lottery](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r38vtf/lucky_lottery_tickets_0dte_spx_puts_1k17k/o52k48l/) continues. While some turned $1k into $17k, others lost their [life savings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r31zzz/bet_everything_but_the_houseshould_i_quit_my_job/o5120wr/) when the market decided to chop for three days straight.

**[TXRH]:** High conviction bullishness here. Apparently, it's the [Walmart of restaurants](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o58ws9j/) and the rolls are the only thing rising faster than our debt.

**[MSTR]:** Michael Saylor is being hailed for his [infinite money glitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3jkk2/at_last_weve_found_it_pure_retardium/o54r67h/). The strategy? If you lose it all, just [refinance the debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3jkk2/at_last_weve_found_it_pure_retardium/o54fsj9/) and roll it forward. Genius.

**[CRSR]:** A broke student managed to print a [1000% gain](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3ro93/broke_student_makes_back_lifetime_market_losses/o576gfe/) on earnings. We expect him to lose it all by Tuesday.

**[MU]:** Traders are buying the [oversold dips](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3si7w/pretty_much_every_other_day_has_been_like_this/o56icrq/) and riding the waves, hoping to quit their jobs before the [cycle ends](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2x76d/6k54k/o51554k/).

**[GOOGL]:** Bears are developing a "[vibesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40hto/my_thesis_was_that_googl_will_dip_below_300_to/o58j2zh/)" that this drops to $285 due to [CapX spending](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40hto/my_thesis_was_that_googl_will_dip_below_300_to/o58cso3/) concerns. 

**[PBR]:** A masterclass in "retarbitrage." One investor went [full margin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3h7zq/i_bought_pbr_petrobras_on_margin_about_100000/o54atzn/) for dividends and is now sending his [fiancé back to Brazil](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3h7zq/i_bought_pbr_petrobras_on_margin_about_100000/o574osa/) with the profits.

**[FVRR]:** Sentiment is [horrendous](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o58yong/). AI is reportedly eating their lunch, and the chart looks like a "retest breakdown" necklace.

**[HOOD]:** They’re launching a new fund, which most regards interpret as [digging through the couch](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r45463/robinhood_ventures_fund_i/o5990bt/) for spare change.

**[WMT]:** Stable [calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o57pizb/) for next week as everyone expects a "good bump" while the rest of the world burns.

**[PANW]:** A "risky" play after the CEO's previous performance, but some are [betting on AI moans](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o592v2a/) to pump it back to life.

In conclusion, the casino is closed on Monday, which means three days of [dark depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58huv4/) before we can lose more money. Remember: if your portfolio is evaporating, just ask your partner if they'd still love you if you were a [toaster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r358hz/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_13_2026/o51sfha/).

Stay degenerate,
