**Fellow Bagholders and Future Wendy’s Associates,**

Welcome to another day in this [unbearably stupid economy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r358hz/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_13_2026/o51x7pv/), where AI is simultaneously destroying your job and your portfolio while we all wait for the [books to be cooked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r358hz/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_13_2026/o525nvq/) to Michelin-star perfection. The general market mood is a mix of "I’m tired, boss" and a frantic search for [Clifford and Shrek emojis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2rlfk/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_12_2026/o4z28x2/). Between Pam Bondi [calling the market top](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2rlfk/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_12_2026/o507g0z/) and the Dow dipping below 50k, our analysts (three raccoons in a trench coat) suggest that the only thing "trickling down" is a [decrepit eagle with Alzheimer’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2rlfk/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_12_2026/o50ncyd/). 

**[HOOD]:** The pure, unadulterated [center of the storm](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4gdohh/). While some "dumbasses" are [getting laughed at](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4oofc3/) for their calls, others are literally betting their [marriages](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4n8ich/) on a moon mission. It’s either [$100 a share](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4msekp/) or a [rehab program](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2avdo/what_happened_to_op/o4wtksy/) for you lot.

**[SPY]:** Investors are [evaporating their portfolios](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r358hz/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_13_2026/o51sfha/) on 0DTE puts while the [chart looks like a dinosaur](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r358hz/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_13_2026/o51sh2c/). One particularly inspired degenerate lost his [fiancé, cat, and life savings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r31zzz/bet_everything_but_the_houseshould_i_quit_my_job/) but still has meat in the freezer, so apparently, the bull run is still on in his [off-grid shack](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r31zzz/bet_everything_but_the_houseshould_i_quit_my_job/).

**[AMZN]:** A true [black belt in Autism™️](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35env/if_amzn_goes_up_8_tomorrow_this_will_be_worth_1/o51uedn/) is betting on an 8% jump with [zero catalysts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35env/if_amzn_goes_up_8_tomorrow_this_will_be_worth_1/o51wppf/). He’s essentially pressing the [delete button](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35env/if_amzn_goes_up_8_tomorrow_this_will_be_worth_1/o51wgm4/) on his bank account, but if it hits, we’re all going to [Blue Origin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35env/if_amzn_goes_up_8_tomorrow_this_will_be_worth_1/o527d6y/).

**[NBIS]:** The [AI savior](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xkdgw/) that everyone loves despite the fact it will [probably drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4wyhn0/) after "great earnings." One user is going [goo goo gah gah](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2rqgw/nebius_nbis_q4_fy_2025_er/o51jm6o/) over big numbers, forgetting they actually need to make a profit eventually. 

**[OPEN]:** Opendoor manages to piss off the entire sub by having a [fake earnings date](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4hricl/) on the calendar. One guy is already planning his [Ferrari purchase](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3zrdc9/) and golf outfits, assuming he doesn't wake up from this [dream](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3zrdc9/) first.

**[ASTS]:** "Ass and Titties" shareholders are currently getting [diluted into the earth's core](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2h3y0/ast_spacemobile_announces_proposed_private/o50zfcl/). Management is apparently [shady as hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2h3y0/ast_spacemobile_announces_proposed_private/o4xml6x/), but the [cult following](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2h3y0/ast_spacemobile_announces_proposed_private/o4x4v2b/) will buy every dip until they're [diluted by 300%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2h3y0/ast_spacemobile_announces_proposed_private/o4x4v2b/).

**[PINS]:** Pinterest is "undervalued" at a [6 P/E](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35ufh/pinterest_loss/o51wpg8/), yet it’s a site for [women to create dream boards](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35ufh/pinterest_loss/o528ca0/). The stock is [tanking](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35ufh/pinterest_loss/o52jpjs/) because the board is mostly [AI slop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35ufh/pinterest_loss/o52hi06/) and garbage ads.

**[SLV]:** Silver is getting its [asshole ripped wide open](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2y87f/16k_gain_on_slv_puts_in_30_minutes/o50nn2s/) by gey bears. Some [lucky regards](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2y87f/16k_gain_on_slv_puts_in_30_minutes/o51gm6m/) made $16k in 30 minutes, while the rest are [scrambling for lotto calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2y87f/16k_gain_on_slv_puts_in_30_minutes/o50cy8c/).

**[MSFT]:** One trader is [playing roulette](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2yk9t/round_3_msft_put_yolo_24k_only_390p_218/o50byyo/) with Microsoft, switching from calls to puts like a [porn star](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2yk9t/round_3_msft_put_yolo_24k_only_390p_218/o515fdv/) getting it from both sides. He’s looking for [tendies or Russian hookers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2yk9t/round_3_msft_put_yolo_24k_only_390p_218/o50b7l4/).

**[MCD]:** McDonald's beat estimates because Americans love [cancer-inducing treats](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2a0g4/mcdonalds_earnings_beat_estimates_as_chains_value/o4wqx1z/) and overpriced [plastic burgers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2a0g4/mcdonalds_earnings_beat_estimates_as_chains_value/o4yvsve/). Apparently, we’ll all be [serving fries to our AI masters](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2a0g4/mcdonalds_earnings_beat_estimates_as_chains_value/o4wenvd/) soon enough.

**[TD]:** Shorting Canadian banks is the [most retarded thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3187h/i_was_wrong_on_td_puts/o52ffhn/) you can do. Those cats up north play [17th dimensional chess](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3187h/i_was_wrong_on_td_puts/o510p9h/) while we’re busy eating [paint chips](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35ufh/pinterest_loss/o528r28/). 

**[COIN]:** Crypto volume is down, and [bozos are shorting it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4yb79r/), so of course, it [can’t go down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4yb79r/). One guy spent his [chocolate and flower money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o511217/) on puts instead—good luck on the couch, buddy.

**[SHOP]:** Shopify is a [Instagram impulse buy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3zrdc9/) play, but the sentiment is a mix of ["can it tank more?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3y55gd/) and hoping for a [mcgriddle](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3zrdc9/).

**[CVNA]:** Shorting this [outright manipulated](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2xgup/cvna_puts_profit_to_spy_puts_2400840017k/o50b5lq/) cult stock actually worked for one [lucky bastard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2xgup/cvna_puts_profit_to_spy_puts_2400840017k/o503419/), but don't hold your breath for a [long fall](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2xgup/cvna_puts_profit_to_spy_puts_2400840017k/o51t2bt/).

**[APP]:** Applovin apparently made someone [$100k last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xeb0o/), but the market doesn't care enough to [beat and raise](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xeb0o/)—it'll just pull a "Reddit."

At the end of the day, remember that [money isn’t real](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2rlfk/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_12_2026/o506u5m/). Diversification is just a fancy way to [lose money on multiple tickers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r358hz/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_13_2026/o52np3x/) at once. If you’re feeling extra [regarded](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2xz93/gld_puts_in_the_red_until_11am_crash/o506h4f/), just remember to [CTRL + Z](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2rlfk/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_12_2026/o4yyyny/) to undo your trades. 

Just put the fries in the bag, bro,
