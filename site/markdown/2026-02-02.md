Fellow Bags-of-Holding,

Welcome to another week of terminal brain rot. The market mood is currently a cocktail of [satanic pedophile cults](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtt6ym/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_02_2026/o36c3x0/) and [pure retard strength](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtt6ym/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_02_2026/o355nva/). While the “Great Recession of 2026” [lasted roughly six hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtt6ym/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_02_2026/o355zqa/), our analysts spent the weekend squinting at an earnings calendar with [30% fewer pixels](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2n1ash/) than a 1990s GameBoy. Whether you’re betting on [mangoes or minerals](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtt6ym/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_02_2026/o358usv/), remember: the V-recovery never fails, and neither does the [line at the Wendy's dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qu2j6t/got_my_lofe_savings_on_qqq_put/o3723o2/).

**[RDDT]:** Sentiment is split between “to the moon” and [burning asses](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qtoqc/). Bullish degenerates are [full porting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2svqu8/) ahead of earnings, betting on user growth, while others note it has [dropped every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtt6ym/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_02_2026/o35azl5/) for three weeks.

**[ANPA]:** A historic [pump and dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtig67/tiktoks_most_popular_influencer_sold_his_company/o34lris/). This sketchy Chinese “printing company” is buying TikTok’s Khaby Lame for $975M in shares. With auditors like [Wei Wei & Co](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtig67/tiktoks_most_popular_influencer_sold_his_company/o33iloq/) resigning, it’s clearly a [pig slaughter farm](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtig67/tiktoks_most_popular_influencer_sold_his_company/o34lris/) for retail exit liquidity.

**[PLTR]:** The implied move is [nearly 11%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o300r7c/). Investors are either buying calls or calling Alex Karp an [overvalued piece of shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o36s7l0/). Sentiment is so bad that the only logical conclusion is a [moon mission](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mvpcu/).

**[ORCL]:** Planning a [$50 billion capital raise](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-raise-50-billion-2026-235033434.html) to dig out of a debt hole. Critics say they’re betting the farm on an [unprofitable OpenAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtuh0m/oracle_6_premarket_after_plans_45b_to_50b_capital/o35js4z/), but the stock pumped 6% anyway because [dilution is the new catalyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtuh0m/oracle_6_premarket_after_plans_45b_to_50b_capital/o368yjk/).

**[MSTR]:** Saylor’s stack is [officially underwater](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/01/31/michael-saylor-s-bitcoin-stack-is-officially-underwater-but-here-s-why-he-likely-won-t-reach-for-the-panic-button). Some report seeing him [cleaning windshields](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtajzr/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_02_2026/o31mdcf/) for fiat coins. It’s a [MacroTragedy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2v1dti/) unless 1 BTC actually equals 1 BTC.

**[TSLA]:** No longer a car company, apparently—it’s now a [vaporware and robot](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vqpjl/) firm. While Elon avoids [Epstein island](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vrsj5/) chatter, bears are betting [$162k on a double-or-nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtipbu/162000_double_or_nothing_that_tesla_closes_below/o334ns8/) crash.

**[AMD]:** Bulls are screaming for [generational money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2rw83e/) and $250 calls. If Intel can bid up on a shit report, [AMD will rip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mqhw4/)—or so the prophecy goes.

**[SLV]:** The “pirate metals” are [tanking hard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qu2j6t/got_my_lofe_savings_on_qqq_put/o378q8b/). One poor soul [lost $50k](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtluhq/strong_week_for_silver/o349iw5/) in two hours, proving that silver is just a [hedge against reality](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtluhq/strong_week_for_silver/o3511mi/).

**[MSFT]:** One student yoloed [his entire $12k tuition](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtlxu7/12k_worth_of_msft_calls_as_a_student/o33sy3x/) into calls. He’s about to learn a lesson [no finance class can teach](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtlxu7/12k_worth_of_msft_calls_as_a_student/o33wdcx/).

**[QQQ]:** A moment of silence for the man who put his [“lofe savings”](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qu2j6t/got_my_lofe_savings_on_qqq_put/o371j0r/) on daily puts while the market ripped. At least [Wendy’s has AI drive-thrus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qu2j6t/got_my_lofe_savings_on_qqq_put/o377tv5/) to welcome him home.

**[U]:** Unity is being compared to the [Catholic Church](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtzidm/unity_is_the_catholic_church_genie_3_is_taking/)—old and heavily monetized—while Google’s Genie 3 is a [hallucination on acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtzidm/unity_is_the_catholic_church_genie_3_is_taking/). 

**[SMCI]:** YOLO calls are back. One investor is ready to either print or become a [processed McRib](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtketl/smci_yolo/o33jtwg/).

If you’re down 95%, remember: you’re only [one aggressive futures trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qssji6/5k_to_719k_in_a_month_and_a_half_the_revenge_of/) away from God-mode or absolute zero. Just make sure to save enough for a [lofe of bread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qu2j6t/got_my_lofe_savings_on_qqq_put/o3752pm/).

Stay thirsty for liquidity,
