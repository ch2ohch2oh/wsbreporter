Greetings, Fellow Liquidity Providers,

Welcome to another day in the most [boring crash of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7iiu1/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_18_2026/o5y3802/). While the [Dow flirted with 50,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7457f/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_17_2026/o5utq9t/) like it was the "forever top," our portfolio is currently a [gelatinous goo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6lptj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_17_2026/o5t4wy4/) of broken dreams and [unrealized losses](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7cf34/msft_losses/o5weuc7/). The vibe on the floor is "bipolar ass market"—where [AI spend is bullish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7iiu1/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_18_2026/o5xrzta/) one minute and a [rugpull-in-waiting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69rqb/western_digital_says_2026_hdd_capacity_100_sold/o5oosuj/) the next. We’ve managed to [round-trip $12k to zero](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7iiu1/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_18_2026/o5xmnqm/), but don't worry—the [morale will continue](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6lptj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_17_2026/o5sy21h/) until the beatings improve.

**[ZIM]:** The absolute standout of the day. Some [insider AF](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69zr6/zim_play_and_i_didnt_even_know_about_the_buyout/o5pe5l2/) degenerate managed to turn [20k into 250k](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r77tam/zim_20k_250k_in_a_few_trading_hours_friday_noon/) on a [buyout rumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69zr6/zim_play_and_i_didnt_even_know_about_the_buyout/) involving Hapag-Lloyd while the rest of us were [sleeping](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69zr6/zim_play_and_i_didnt_even_know_about_the_buyout/o5oswv7/). It’s a [straight up robbery](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69zr6/zim_play_and_i_didnt_even_know_about_the_buyout/o5oswv7/), and yes, the [SEC has entered the chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69zr6/zim_play_and_i_didnt_even_know_about_the_buyout/o5oyn16/). 

**[NVDA]:** Our favorite [AI circlejerk merchant](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7k52y/partnership_announcement_meta_builds_ai/o5y51fy/) is back at it. Despite a [partnership with Meta](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/meta-builds_ai-infrastructure-with-nvidia), the stock is [barely green](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7k52y/partnership_announcement_meta_builds_ai/o5xzhvh/), leading some to believe [any news is bearish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7k52y/partnership_announcement_meta_builds_ai/o5y3y73/) at this point. Still, the bulls argue that [betting against NVDA is insanity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6qc24/wsb_version_nvda_q4_earnings_analysis_positions/o5scw1s/) as they prepare for a [surge that isn't priced in](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6qc24/wsb_version_nvda_q4_earnings_analysis_positions/).

**[GOOG]:** Alphabet is currently [touching investors in the nono area](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7iiu1/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_18_2026/o5xlk4d/) with [12 straight red days](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7iiu1/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_18_2026/o5xoq0g/). It feels like [God wants us to die](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7457f/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_17_2026/o5v0tvp/), as the stock [shat the bed](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7iiu1/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_18_2026/o5xovo0/) and fell to [300 pre-market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7457f/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_17_2026/o5uuk32/).

**[WD]:** We are officially entering the [HDDpocalypse](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6ud2g/many_consumer_electronics_manufacturers_will_go/o5tvhu2/). Western Digital is [100% sold out](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69rqb/western_digital_says_2026_hdd_capacity_100_sold/) for 2026, and enterprise demand is [gobbling up everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69rqb/western_digital_says_2026_hdd_capacity_100_sold/). Soon, you’ll be [saving documents on stone tablets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69rqb/western_digital_says_2026_hdd_capacity_100_sold/o5qdvhf/) or [scavenging 2010 platters](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r69rqb/western_digital_says_2026_hdd_capacity_100_sold/o5otu1i/) from your basement.

**[MSFT]:** This [POS stock](https://i.redd.it/v8hc5dkw93kg1.png) is apparently [flat since 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7iiu1/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_18_2026/o5y8bc1/). Every [regard told us it prints money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7cf34/msft_losses/o5wee2e/), but now we’re just [burning 10% of the port](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7cf34/msft_losses/o5x7ziw/) on calls that refuse to [make some fucking tendies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7cf34/msft_losses/o5xgn9t/).

**[CVNA]:** It is [puts season](https://preview.redd.it/xfauz4tfxbjg1.jpeg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=519975b0ed89c3398d6b9edaaefbe441ca7d3384) for the car vending machine that [refuses to die](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o57vbrp/). One poor soul got [bodied by the IRS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r73yj5/1161103_cvna_options_loss_wash_sales_resulting_in/o5uqqii/) for $7k in taxes on a [$11k loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r73yj5/1161103_cvna_options_loss_wash_sales_resulting_in/) thanks to wash sales. Truly [financial masochism](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r73yj5/1161103_cvna_options_loss_wash_sales_resulting_in/o5uqqii/).

**[SLV]:** Silver is a [manipulated market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7bw73/big_slv_l/o5ww3na/) that [squeezed deez nuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7bw73/big_slv_l/o5w7ym4/). While some [lost $20](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7bw73/big_slv_l/o5wastr/), others are [throwing money in the bonfire](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7azho/yolo_bet_that_we_smack_iran_after_market_close/o5wzzj1/) with [15k in puts](https://i.redd.it/swukfkog73kg1.jpeg) hoping it [drops to 60](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7c0eh/back_at_it_15k_slv_puts/o5wl7ji/).

**[PANW]:** Palo Alto [slumped 6%](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/palo-alto-networks-panw-q2-2026-earnings.html) and we all know what that means: [Nancy Pelosi must have dumped](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7lxvx/palo_alto_networks_slumps_6_as_third_quarter/o5yewvm/) it a week ago. The [adjusted P/E](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7lxvx/palo_alto_networks_slumps_6_as_third_quarter/o5yg521/) is still higher than the [CEO’s astronomical pay](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7lxvx/palo_alto_networks_slumps_6_as_third_quarter/o5yhruf/).

**[NFLX]:** Netflix is playing [200iq games](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r75b2l/netflix_grants_warner_bros_discovery_7day_waiver/o5v2jvz/) with WBD and Paramount, essentially [calling their bluff](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r75b2l/netflix_grants_warner_bros_discovery_7day_waiver/o5uzcf9/) while waiting for a [$2.8B breakup fee](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r75b2l/netflix_grants_warner_bros_discovery_7day_waiver/o5x2n1h/). It’s a [Big Dick Energy move](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r75b2l/netflix_grants_warner_bros_discovery_7day_waiver/o5uzcf9/) in a [dog-with-fleas](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r75b2l/netflix_grants_warner_bros_discovery_7day_waiver/o5vrubd/) industry.

**[DHT]:** We have a degenerate [yoloing $80k](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7azho/yolo_bet_that_we_smack_iran_after_market_close/) on a bet that the [US smacks Iran](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7azho/yolo_bet_that_we_smack_iran_after_market_close/) before Ramadan. Apparently, the [biggest retard is in charge](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7azho/yolo_bet_that_we_smack_iran_after_market_close/o5wmg9b/), so this tanker play [might actually hit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7azho/yolo_bet_that_we_smack_iran_after_market_close/o5wmg9b/).

**[WMT]:** The [only green hope](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o57p7bg/) in a [sea of dogshit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o585s16/). Regards are loading [WMT calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o5tmser/) because it has [a ‘W’ in the ticker](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o5u3sn2/) and they’re predicting a [20% jump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o5dave0/) on 2% revenue growth.

**[RPI]:** Raspberry Pi [soared 40%](https://www.reuters.com/technology/raspberry-pi-soars-40-ceo-buys-stock-ai-chatter-builds-2026-02-17/) because it’s now the [sleeping giant](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7mv0j/raspberry_pi_is_up_40_after_tam_expansion/o5yjl37/) of AI orchestration. Just ignore the fact that they’re about to get [skull f’d](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7mv0j/raspberry_pi_is_up_40_after_tam_expansion/o5yknio/) by the [RAMpocalypse](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6ud2g/many_consumer_electronics_manufacturers_will_go/).

If the [SEC keeps edging us](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6vdqb/pdt_rule_will_not_be_removed_on_february_28th/o5t79ec/) on the [PDT rule removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6vdqb/pdt_rule_will_not_be_removed_on_february_28th/), we might have to actually [get jobs at Wendy’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6vdqb/pdt_rule_will_not_be_removed_on_february_28th/o5t6vue/)—assuming the [1 million jobs revised down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5pdcs/us_2025_jobs_numbers_revised_down_by_over_1/) haven't already [burned the kitchen](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r5pdcs/us_2025_jobs_numbers_revised_down_by_over_1/o5ki8zc/). Remember: [losing generational wealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r7457f/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_17_2026/o5uqrwm/) is a team sport, and we are currently [bagging the fries](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6lptj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_17_2026/o5ulbcs/) in the state of [acceptance](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r6lptj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_17_2026/o5ulbcs/).

Stay retarded,
