Greetings, Fellow Exit Liquidity,

Brace yourselves, because the apes are hooting for a [sexy week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2p0h4k/) ahead. Despite the fact that our primary analytical tools—the weekly earnings graphics—now look like they were rendered on a [potato in 280P resolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qd0ee/), the sentiment is clear: it’s either a moon mission or we’re updating our resumes for the fry station. While some bears are convinced it’s officially [puts season](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mtbca/), the rest of the herd is busy [full-porting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2svqu8/) into calls with the reckless abandon of a man who just found his wife’s boyfriend’s credit card.

**RDDT:** This is the undisputed heavyweight of the week. Our "experts" are betting on a [return to $200](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2ocpoc/) driven by user growth. Despite many getting their [asses burned](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qtoqc/) by this ticker recently, the consensus is to [go in deep](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qtoqc/) for the ER. One particularly dedicated philanthropist has even been buying [subscriptions all year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2r42m1/) to pump the bottom line—truly the peak of "regarded" financial engineering.

**PLTR:** The logic here is a masterclass in reverse psychology. Since the stock is down 25% in three months and the [sentiment is absolute shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mvpcu/), the only logical conclusion for a degenerate is that it [must moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mvpcu/). We are currently allocating 40% of the fund to this "trust me bro" thesis.

**GOOGL:** The strategy is simple: [All in](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2moklq/). We are eyeing the [330C lottery tickets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mp0c5/) because apparently, fundamental analysis is for people who enjoy staying poor. If Sundar doesn't deliver, I'll see you all at the dumpster for the Tuesday night shift.

**SMCI:** We have a classic case of cognitive dissonance. While some are clutching [4-call positions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mplbq/) like a life raft, others are correctly identifying it as [literally the worst company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2o210c/). We’ve decided to follow both sets of advice simultaneously to ensure maximum loss porn.

**AMD:** The directive from the front lines is to [fucking send it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mp0c5/) with [250C](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mp0c5/) strikes. We aren’t sure where it’s being sent, but based on our track record, it’s likely straight to a Chapter 11 filing.

If these earnings don't [save our portfolios](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2omjca/), I’ve already pre-ordered the HCM-branded cardboard boxes for our new office under the overpass. Remember: [earnings don't mean shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mx4j0/) anymore, so just close your eyes, hit the "buy" button, and pray the Reddit servers don't crash before you can post your losses.

May your hands be diamond and your brain be smooth,
