Fellow Exit Liquidities,

Welcome back to the salt mines. The overall market vibe is a [mentally unstable shit show](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o490qvh/) where logic has been replaced by “on-chain vibes.” While the SPY somehow [erased a week of losses](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3yw6i4/) in a single day, retail traders are still getting [decimated](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3yw3d8/). The consensus? Don’t trust the Monday rally, mostly because [hot girls are working shit jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/o493yas/)—the ultimate recession indicator. If your UberEats arrives via a [white woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/o4925sk/), it’s time to buy puts. 

**HIMS:** The telehealth darling is currently getting its [asshole prepared](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyr0v5/hims_yolo/o47ksql/) after the FDA nuked their [copycat Wegovy pill](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyo3ey/hims_hers_to_stop_offering_copies_of_novo/o458rlw/). Shareholders are [poking the bear](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxyf5k/a_tale_of_poking_the_bear_hims/o3zvdly/) and finding out that "moving fast and breaking things" doesn't work when the thing you’re breaking is [federal drug law](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyo3ey/hims_hers_to_stop_offering_copies_of_novo/o47h26n/).

**RDDT:** A masterclass in [pure retardium](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxt56j/rddt/o3z5zm6/). Investors managed the rare "Triple Play," [losing money on shares, calls, and puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxt56j/rddt/o3ywdsu/) simultaneously. It turns out [insider selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxt56j/rddt/o3z2xl1/) is a more effective weight-loss drug for your portfolio than anything HIMS ever sold.

**NBIS:** This ticker is being begged to [save AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xkdgw/) after a week that [aged investors 10 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3yxqfs/). Expectations are high for a [big move](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o40260u/), assuming it doesn't just [fuck it up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xp9vd/).

**MSTR:** Up [26% after a 12B loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3yxo2g/). It’s a [sophisticated trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxvoag/welcome_to_ebt_buddy/o3zjd7e/) that 99.99% of Wall Street doesn't understand, probably because it’s just [gambling on roulette](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxvoag/welcome_to_ebt_buddy/o3zjd7e/) with extra steps.

**HOOD:** Sentiment is split between [easy calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o45qbo7/) because it’s "beaten down" and [puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xjhiy/) because [corn](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3yyupw/) (crypto) doesn't know how to pump.

**WEN:** The only ticker with a [100% success rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xdwk0/). We’re bullish on the [frosty](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3zrdc9/), but only because half of you are [filling out applications](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xih3n/) for the night shift.

**OPEN:** Expected to be a [BIG money mover](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o481tzv/), which usually translates to adding another [-33% to the port](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o481tzv/).

**APP:** Applovin made one guy [100 fucking grand](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xeb0o/) last year, but the consensus is the market [won't care](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xeb0o/) this time around.

**RACE:** Ferrari calls are in play because investors [wanna drive one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o46us8d/) or just [cruise around sipping Mexican coke](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3zrdc9/) while laughing at Ford owners.

**PLTR:** Bears are calling for [puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/) as they expect a [beta-fisting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/o49cpj5/) by the upcoming jobs report. 

**QQQ:** Some legend turned [$300 into $16,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyfyqz/well_boys_and_girls_im_back_with_another_crazy/o439md6/) and is now holding calls over the weekend like a [max regard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyfyqz/well_boys_and_girls_im_back_with_another_crazy/o43dqqy/).

**GDRX:** Apparently [TrumpRx is just a front](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxgldf/trumprx_is_a_front_for_gdrx_but_nobody_cares/o3w4u0t/) for GoodRX tech, but the real question is whether we can get [cheap adderall and viagra](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxgldf/trumprx_is_a_front_for_gdrx_but_nobody_cares/o3wddu9/) through it.

If you’re currently [struggling, just remember nobody cares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o47mnpo/). Go [touch some grass](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3yzgjt/) or smoke it if you’ve still got the cash. Monday will either be [Shrek green](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxsn2j/thought_this_was_free_money_now_a_rddt_holder/o3yr7oa/) or we'll all be [selling ourselves behind a Wendy's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyr0v5/hims_yolo/o45qwvp/).

Stay regarded,
