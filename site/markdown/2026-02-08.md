Distinguished Exit Liquidity,

The market vibe is currently a cocktail of Super Bowl-induced delirium and the realization that "character development" is just a fancy term for [losing your entire inheritance](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qy03z0/life_of_a_regard/o408smj/). While most of you were sweating over prop bets, our proprietary "Recessionary Hottie Index" flashed a code red: multiple reports of [hot white girls delivering DoorDash](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/o4925sk/) suggest the economy is about to get [beta-fisted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/) by upcoming CPI data. Whether you're [addicted to 3x leverage](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzklw7/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_09_2026/o4bk2hm/) or just [poor and going to work](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzklw7/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_09_2026/o4bio61/), here is where the money is currently dying:

**[HIMS]:** Our favorite telehealth dropshipper is currently [more fried than a KFC 3-piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyo3ey/hims_hers_to_stop_offering_copies_of_novo/o46jm9d/) after the FDA and DOJ decided to [poke the bear](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxyf5k/a_tale_of_poking_the_bear_hims/). Apparently, mass-marketing [Chinese Ozempic knock-offs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxvoc5/hims_hers_health_12_after_hours_after_hours_after_fda_moves/o3zqq5q/) wasn’t the legal "sure thing" management's [lawyers claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyo3ey/hims_hers_to_stop_offering_copies_of_novo/o458rlw/).

**[RDDT]:** Sentiment is a [powder keg](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzjzun/rddt_is_a_powder_keg/) as we wait for the Anthropic lawsuit to settle. Half the sub is [loading shares at every dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzjzun/rddt_is_a_powder_keg/o4byeqo/), while the other half is realizing the platform is [filled with propaganda bots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qynkvk/can_someone_pick_me_up_on_the_way_to_155_by_march/o44z2w7/). We're officially [RDDTARDED](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxt56j/rddt/o3ywzzw/).

**[QQQ]:** One legendary degenerate turned [$300 into $16,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyfyqz/well_boys_and_girls_im_back_with_another_crazy/) and decided the best move was to [go in raw](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyfyqz/well_boys_and_girls_im_back_with_another_crazy/o448849/) with calls expiring Monday. We expect him to have a [new box next to ours](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyfyqz/well_boys_and_girls_im_back_with_another_crazy/o43x6ah/) by Tuesday.

**[PLTR]:** Bears are betting the farm on [puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/), claiming any Monday rally is just [exit liquidity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/) for the big boys. The thesis? If the [UberEats girl is hot](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/o49f2qv/), your portfolio is toast.

**[HOOD]:** Despite being [beaten down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3yx4dl/), the [easy calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o45qbo7/) crowd thinks earnings will send this flying. Most of us just want to [get fked by HOOD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3zcg9d/) one last time for old time's sake.

**[NBIS]:** The new AI hope. Some are [full porting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzklw7/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_09_2026/o4bjrm2/) calls because the CEO "literally can't go tits up." It’s basically a [prayer circle](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o413sdt/) at this point.

**[RACE]:** Ferrari calls are trending solely because regards want to [drive one VROOOOMM](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o46us8d/). Groundbreaking fundamental analysis as always.

**[BULL]:** The [negative sentiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qy5kvm/major_loss/o42k8cj/) on Webull is reaching critical mass. Between the [constant rugging](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qy5kvm/major_loss/o45t5ic/) and delisting fears, it’s a true test of who can [HODL](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qy5kvm/major_loss/o41b1fv/) the longest while their phone battery dies.

**[OPEN]:** Management is promising a [BIG money mover](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o481tzv/), but investors are mostly just preparing to add another [-33% to their ports](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o481tzv/).

**[SPY]:** After a [red day](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qytcsh/spy_calls_after_red_day/), the brave are grabbing calls, hoping for [Shrek green](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxsn2j/thought_this_was_free_money_now_a_rddt_holder/o3yr7oa/) candles. Just remember: it’s not a loss until you [click sell](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qy5kvm/major_loss/o41bi5q/).

**[SHOP]:** Expected to have [earth-shattering profits](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xo8vi/) only to tank into a black hole because the market [doesn't care](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xeb0o/).

**[CORN/BTC]:** The weekend pump is being viewed as [manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/) to create more [exit liquidity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/o494us0/). It keeps [disappearing into thin air](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzklw7/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_09_2026/o4caae6/) faster than my interest in a savings account.

Remember, if you’re [tired of living this way](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzoqq2/transferring_my_bullshit_retirement_into_my_day/), you can always [transfer your retirement into a day trading account](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzoqq2/transferring_my_bullshit_retirement_into_my_day/). What’s the worst that could happen? You end up [selling yourself behind a Wendy’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyr0v5/hims_yolo/o45qwvp/)? That’s just a career pivot.

Inversely yours,
