Greetings, Fellow Bagholders and Future Wendy's Associates,

The vibe today is a toxic slurry of institutional panic and retail [delusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quoib6/fund_managers_are_holding_the_lowest_cash_levels/o3bjfix/). Fund managers are currently holding the [lowest cash levels on record](https://i.redd.it/vfljal9ob9hg1.png), which means the "smart money" is just as [leveraged to the tits](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quoib6/fund_managers_are_holding_the_lowest_cash_levels/o3cfq2l/) as the average degenerate gambling in his parents' basement. Between the [diabolical rugpulls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quq3rx/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_03_2026/o3cnr5z/) and the general [enshittification](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qus4ll/disney_names_theme_parks_head_josh_damaro_as_new/o3ccih5/) of corporate leadership, we’re essentially trading in a [clown world](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quubit/walmart_joins_1_trillion_club_as_tech_frugal/o3d37iu/) where Walmart is a tech giant and Intel thinks hiring an executive is a [bullish catalyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qv01e0/intel_ceo_says_company_will_make_gpus_has_hired/o3dz51p/). Even the earnings graphics are [getting uglier](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mpypy/), matching the aesthetic of our collective YTD returns.

**PYPL:** The undisputed king of [PAINPAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quqjxr/serious_question_how_are_yall_paypal_bulls/o3bx3c8/). Shares were [clobbered](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quqlwo/paypal_shares_clobbered_in_premarket_wow/) in premarket after guidance proved the company is basically a [Radio Shack with a tech stack](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quqlwo/paypal_shares_clobbered_in_premarket_wow/o3bxxnb/) from 2006. One particularly enlightened regard [switched from puts to calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quqjxr/serious_question_how_are_yall_paypal_bulls/o3c9w7o/) at the last second, lighting $1.5k on fire for our entertainment.

**PLTR:** "Tangerine Palpatine" and his [surveillance empire](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qu7t4t/palantir_q4_earnings_beat_wall_street_estimates/o386i77/) beat estimates, but bears are screaming about a [P/E of 343](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qu7t4t/palantir_q4_earnings_beat_wall_street_estimates/o38sbqj/). It’s the most important software company of our generation, mostly because the [government is funneling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qu7t4t/palantir_q4_earnings_beat_wall_street_estimates/o387m6t/) our tax dollars directly into Alex Karp’s bear-hunting budget.

**WMT:** Officially joined the [Trillion Dollar Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quubit/walmart_joins_1_trillion_club_as_tech_frugal/) because apparently, if you sell cheap plastic and pay employees so little they need [government aid](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quubit/walmart_joins_1_trillion_club_as_tech_frugal/o3ctt71/), Wall Street values you like a [high-growth AI firm](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quubit/walmart_joins_1_trillion_club_as_tech_frugal/o3crnvb/). It’s a [recession signal](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quubit/walmart_joins_1_trillion_club_as_tech_frugal/o3cxn3y/) masquerading as a success story.

**RDDT:** Bulls are [full porting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2svqu8/) into Reddit, betting it could [surprise everyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2ocpoc/) with user growth. It seems the "wallstreetbets-ification" of the market is complete when we're [all-in on the platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mtbca/) we use to lose money.

**TSLA:** Elon is a [wizard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quq3rx/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_03_2026/o3cwhti/) who just merged SpaceX with xAI to [bury those pesky Twitter loans](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qu7z5y/elon_musks_spacex_to_combine_with_xai_ahead_of/o38r4g2/). Despite the [vaporware and unhinged AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qu7z5y/elon_musks_spacex_to_combine_with_xai_ahead_of/o38ezf6/), it remains green because logic is for poor people.

**AMD:** The "generational money" play. Degenerates are [sending it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mp0c5/) with $250 calls, convinced that if [shitty Intel](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mqhw4/) is being bid up, AMD must be headed for Andromeda.

**SNDK/WDC:** Memory stocks are apparently [free money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quajyq/buy_the_dip_on_any_memory_stock_sndk_mu_stx_wdc/o38xhl2/) right now. WDC just added [$4 billion to buybacks](https://www.reuters.com/business/western-digital-adds-4-billion-buyback-plan-ai-boosts-memory-chip-sales-2026-02-03/) to keep the rocket [fueled](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quajyq/buy_the_dip_on_any_memory_stock_sndk_mu_stx_wdc/o38zavd/) for its next all-time high.

**INTC:** Announced they’ll make GPUs again by [hiring a lead executive](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qv01e0/intel_ceo_says_company_will_make_gpus_has_hired/o3dz51p/). The crowd is rightfully asking if they [forgot they already make Arc GPUs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qv01e0/intel_ceo_says_company_will_make_gpus_has_hired/o3dz3ub/), which have the performance of a wet potato.

**MSFT:** My estimation of this stock as a blue chip has [plummeted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quq3rx/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_03_2026/o3cgbvt/). Investors are [selling at these prices](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quq3rx/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_03_2026/o3cd61z/) while begging for the stock to [wake the fuck up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quq3rx/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_03_2026/o3bxlgg/).

**DIS:** Named the theme parks head as [new CEO](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260203045616/en/Josh-DAmaro-Named-Next-Chief-Executive-Officer-of-The-Walt-Disney-Company). Expect [churro prices to double](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qus4ll/disney_names_theme_parks_head_josh_damaro_as_new/o3c902z/) and [Disney+ Lightning Lane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qus4ll/disney_names_theme_parks_head_josh_damaro_as_new/o3cv632/) streaming subscriptions to facilitate the enshittification.

**NFLX:** Some hero is yoloing his [tuition money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quw23h/nflx_yolo/) on $100 calls, proving that a college education is secondary to a [Japanese friend's "YORO" philosophy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quw23h/nflx_yolo/o3doxkv/).

**QQQ:** RIP to the guy who lost his [lofe savings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qu2j6t/got_my_lofe_savings_on_qqq_put/) on $90k of puts. He wasn't wrong, he was just [early](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quq3rx/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_03_2026/o3djrn7/). Lofe is hard, trading is harder.

If your portfolio isn't bleeding, you're probably [not doing it right](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quq3rx/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_03_2026/o3cq0gy/). Between the [SpaceX-xAI IPO mania](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qu7z5y/elon_musks_spacex_to_combine_with_xai_ahead_of/o38alql/) and the [death of PayPal](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1quqdo5/painpal_hurts_13k/), the only thing more certain than a rugpull is the [Wendy’s dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qux824/finally_hit_1k_at_21_years_old_dm_me_for/o3dc73c/) waiting for us at the end of the week.

Yours in terminal poverty,
