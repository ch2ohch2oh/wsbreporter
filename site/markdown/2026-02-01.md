Greetings, Fellow Bagholders and Future Wendy's Employees,

Welcome to another week of "How Is This Legal?" Last week was a [huge week for degenerates](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2vfnnv/), and by that, I mean we’re all collectively staring at earnings graphics that look like they were [designed by a toddler with 280p resolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mpypy/). The market mood is a delightful cocktail of [sensory overload](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mmdfk/) and pure [tomfoolery](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtajzr/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_02_2026/o31xca3/), with half of you screaming "calls on everything" while the other half prepares to [assess the damage at Friday's close](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtajzr/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_02_2026/o31f1v9/).

**THE TRENDING TICKERS**

**[RDDT]:** Sentiment is reaching [full port](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2svqu8/) levels of insanity. Bulls are betting on [continued user growth](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2ocpoc/) to send this to the [fucking moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2r42m1/), ignoring the fact that many of us are [too poor to even buy subscriptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2r42m1/).

**[SLV]:** After the [largest single-day drop in history](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2ngblh/), the "Silver Gang" is looking a bit [missing a leg or an arm](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtajzr/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_02_2026/o31zuck/). The [CME hiked margins](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2t1jui/) right after the puke, proving that [banks hate you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2ty5mc/).

**[BTC]:** Our favorite [magic internet coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtajzr/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_02_2026/o31hd7l/) is drilling so hard it might turn into an [oil rig](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsynb5/15k_short_on_bitcoin_bitcoin_to_the_earth/o2yw6qx/). Some [regards are shorting the bottom](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsynb5/15k_short_on_bitcoin_bitcoin_to_the_earth/o2yvdu6/), which is a [perfect bottom signal](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsynb5/15k_short_on_bitcoin_bitcoin_to_the_earth/o2z7rlw/) for the rest of us.

**[TSLA]:** Elon has officially decided [it’s no longer a car company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vom7b/). Apparently, it’s now a [vaporware company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vqpjl/) or a [robot maid company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2w19yk/). Either way, the [PE ratio is still making everyone hallucinate](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vz99t/).

**[NVDA]:** Chaos reigned over rumors of a [rugged OpenAI deal](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qss9kt/nvda_just_rugged_openai_100b_deal_dead_my_calls/o2xpdiv/), but Jensen Huang quickly [reminded everyone who’s in charge](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qss9kt/nvda_just_rugged_openai_100b_deal_dead_my_calls/o2xqvqa/) by confirming a massive investment. [Believe it or not, calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qss9kt/nvda_just_rugged_openai_100b_deal_dead_my_calls/o32fbvm/).

**[SNDK]:** Being hailed as the [best pure momentum play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v17qe/) due to a [tiny float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v1ab1/) and the AI memory bottleneck. [Buy the $700 calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v1ab1/) and pray you aren't the [exit liquidity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2w1r2n/).

**[PLTR]:** Sentiment is so [shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mvpcu/) that the contrarians think it [must moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mvpcu/). With an [implied move of nearly 11%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o300r7c/), expect plenty of loss porn by Tuesday.

**[MSTR]:** Michael Saylor is [officially underwater](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uwfhn/) and allegedly [cleaning windshields for fiat coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtajzr/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_02_2026/o31mdcf/). The [Macro-Debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uwrdj/) strategy is looking more like a [Ponzi scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uxi32/) every day.

**[AMD]:** Degenerates are [sending it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mp0c5/) with $250 calls, convinced that [AMD will RIP](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mo6g4/)—and not the "Rest In Peace" kind—after seeing Intel’s [shit earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mqhw4/) bid up.

**[GFS]:** Rumors of a [short squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbnav/globalfoundries_gfs_has_10125_institutional/o2u9te5/) are swirling because [institutions own 101% of the float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbnav/globalfoundries_gfs_has_10125_institutional/o2ug4z9/). It’s either a [genius move](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbnav/globalfoundries_gfs_has_10125_institutional/o2ubu2o/) or a [one-way ticket to bankruptcy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbnav/globalfoundries_gfs_has_10125_institutional/o2uioer/).

**[SpaceX]:** With a [fictional $1.5T valuation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2u8mmq/) and [cooked books](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2ub0vo/) that ignore depreciation, it’s the [biggest IPO pump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2uddny/) we've ever seen.

**[ORCL]:** Larry Ellison is [liquidating 30k jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pvuoo/) to fund the OpenAI [money pit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2qvrbn/). In this market, [cutting workers is bullish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2sg6h5/).

**[MSFT]:** Apparently, Microsoft [underperformed the S&P 500](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsixft/msft_has_underperformed_the_sp_500_in_the_past_5/o2vuhxk/) for five years. Investors are calling it ["Microslop"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsixft/msft_has_underperformed_the_sp_500_in_the_past_5/o2wa616/) and suggesting we change the ticker to [SLOP](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsixft/msft_has_underperformed_the_sp_500_in_the_past_5/o2wa616/).

**[GOOGL]:** Bulls are [all in](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2moklq/), convinced [Gemini monetization](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2vceg0/) is going to pump this after earnings.

If you’re currently [shitting bricks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsq46v/slv_puts_it_finally_paid_out/o2xo8l3/) because you bought the silver dip, just remember: [money isn’t real](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs651t/gold_trading_platform_of_collapsing_after_users/o2tqu7d/) and [Canadian currency is fake](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qtdu4q/intel_regard/o326j3z/). If everything fails, there’s always a [warm spot behind the Wendy’s dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2njs9b/) waiting for you.

See you at the bottom,
