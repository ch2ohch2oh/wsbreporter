Fellow Degenerates,

The market is currently moving like a [piece of shit meme coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2obayd/), and frankly, the vibe is a complete disaster. Between the [ugliest graphics](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mpypy/) known to man and [280P resolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qd0ee/) earnings charts, we’re flying blind into what looks like a [sexy week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2p0h4k/) of losses. While the [entire US economy is a Jenga tower](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxzbb/), we’re focusing on the only thing that matters: losing money with maximum confidence.

**SLV/GLD:** The "safe haven" trade just committed seppuku. Metals suffered the [largest single-day drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2ngblh/) in history, proving that [gold can't go up $500 every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2ocwkv/). While a few [metal motherfuckers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2oavvi/) printed a [50+ bagger](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2nifsp/) on 0DTE puts, most of you are just [staring at shiny stones](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2ocfjo/) while the [CME crooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2u22me/) jack up margins.

**RDDT:** Our home turf is the only thing [saving portfolios](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2omjca/) this week. Bulls are betting the farm on [continued user growth](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2ocpoc/) and [buying subscriptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2r42m1/) to pump the stock. Sentiment is aggressively bullish, with calls [fucking sending it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mp0c5/) toward a potential $200 price target.

**NVDA:** Jensen Huang is playing 4D chess with our emotions. Reports that he [rugged OpenAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qss9kt/nvda_just_rugged_openai_100b_dead_my_calls/o2xpdiv/) were labeled [fake news](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qss9kt/nvda_just_rugged_openai_100b_dead_my_calls/o2xsw24/), but the volatility is real. Whether he’s [saving $100B](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qss9kt/nvda_just_rugged_openai_100b_dead_my_calls/o2xt9h1/) or making the [largest investment in history](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qss9kt/nvda_just_rugged_openai_100b_dead_my_calls/o2y43pn/), we’re staying long because if AI dies, there [won’t be enough Wendy’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qss9kt/nvda_just_rugged_openai_100b_dead_my_calls/o2xpz85/) for all of us.

**TSLA:** Tesla has officially [pivoted away from cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vplr9/) because BYD is [whooping its ass](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vq1jt/). Elon is now [all-in on robots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vq5es/), even though they look like [dudes in spandex](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vrs5t/). Most of us are buying puts because it’s a [$30k maid we can't fuck](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2w19yk/).

**MSTR/BTC:** Michael Saylor’s [macro debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uwrdj/) is finally [underwater](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uwfhn/). Bitcoin is taking a trip to the center of the Earth, and the [bottom is confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsynb5/15k_short_on_bitcoin_bitcoin_to_the_earth/o2z7rlw/) because some regard just [shorted $15k](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsynb5/15k_short_on_bitcoin_bitcoin_to_the_earth/o2yukhm/) after the liquidation already happened. Truly, a [god among men](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsynb5/15k_short_on_bitcoin_bitcoin_to_the_earth/o2yvqxn/).

**SNDK:** For the few of you who still like [actual DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v1ab1/), Sandisk is the new [pure momentum play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v9l9c/). With a [tiny float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v1ab1/) and analysts [chasing a $1,000 target](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v8gjb/), it’s the perfect place to blow your [Wendy's budget](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v1ab1/).

If you’re currently down big, just remember: there’s always a [chance you can come back](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qssji6/5k_to_719k_in_a_month_and_a_half_the_revenge_of/). Or, you can just accept that we’re all [exit liquidity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2njb1d/) and head for the [dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qss9kt/nvda_just_rugged_openai_100b_dead_my_calls/o2xsdl0/).
