Greetings, Fellow Bagholders and Hindsight Heroes,

The market currently has the structural integrity of a [Jenga tower](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxzbb/), and the mood is somewhere between [feeling nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2oc3dr/) after losing $45k and wondering if your [local bank](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrnpms/how_do_i_get_a_refund/o2pk7e2/) accepts "GIVE ME MONEY" notes as a valid withdrawal strategy. Between [gold fever](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsh6sp/chinas_gold_fever_sparks_us1_billion_scandal_as/o2vibae/) turning into a $1 billion Chinese rug pull and a [40 trillion dollar market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2obayd/) moving like a piece of shit meme coin, Hindsight Henry is here to tell you exactly how you should have lost your money yesterday.

**SLV/GLD:** The "safe havens" just turned into a slaughterhouse. We witnessed the [largest single-day drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2ngblh/) in history while the CME [jacked margins](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2t434p/) like a classic collection agency. Whether it’s [market manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2tr2z5/) or just the [Universe punishing](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qroolh/a_timeline_of_todays_silver_crash_and_its/o2qrpeo/) the one guy who finally bought the top, the verdict is clear: if you can’t [hold it in your hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsh6sp/chinas_gold_fever_sparks_us1_billion_scandal_as/o2vni7b/), it isn’t yours. 

**RDDT:** The bulls are [full porting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2svqu8/) on Reddit, hoping the stock can [save their portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2omjca/) after a month of [getting their asses burned](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qtoqc/). Sentiment is so high people are [buying subscriptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2r42m1/) just to pump the user growth numbers. Moon it is.

**TSLA:** Musk’s AI pivot has investors convinced this is the [next Enron](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vphfs/). Now that BYD [whooped their ass](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vq1jt/), they’re no longer a car company, just a [MEME stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vq21j/) selling [dudes in spandex suits](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vrs5t/) as "robots" and lidar-mapping your house for [political heresy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vsggb/).

**SNDK:** Apparently, this is the [best pure momentum play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v17qe/) left. Tiny float plus [AI memory hype](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v1ab1/) equals violent movement. One guy is even betting his [Wendy's budget](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v1ab1/) on Feb 20 $700 calls because he can't afford March.

**ORCL:** Oracle is officially [one of us](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pvuoo/), liquidating its [profitable businesses](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxwcd/) just to fund a money-burning deal with [OpenAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxy48/). Laying off 30,000 people to pay off [debt obligations](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pvuoo/)—it’s the American dream in a blender.

**GFS:** A [suspect volume spike](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbnav/globalfoundries_gfs_has_10125_institutional/o2vrkx0/) and [101% institutional ownership](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbnav/globalfoundries_gfs_has_10125_institutional/o2ug4z9/) have the "actual DD" crew screaming for calls. It’s [pure old-school autism](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbnav/globalfoundries_gfs_has_10125_institutional/o2uioer/) that might just lead us to the promised land or the food stamp line.

**MSTR:** Saylor is [officially underwater](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uwfhn/), proving that [macro debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uwrdj/) for digital corn might be [less than prudent](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uwvhd/). The crypto bros are in [crisis mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uxiyh/), and we’re just here for the [hero memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2v05n0/).

If you’re still solvent, you’re doing it wrong. We’re moving into a future where [building wealth is impossible](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrb96n/here_is_the_person_who_was_just_nominated_to_be/o2nf7mo/) and we’ll all be in [debt to OpenAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2q8iha/). See you Monday for the 0DTE lottery.

Stay regarded,
