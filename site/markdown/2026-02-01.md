Fellow Degenerates,

I hope you’re reading this from a library computer because you can no longer afford home internet. The market currently has the structural integrity of a [Jenga tower](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxzbb/) and the overall vibe is somewhere between a funeral and a riot at a [Wendy’s dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsd887/all_right_you_perverts/o2vcgvv/). A $40 trillion market just moved like a [piece of shit meme coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2obayd/), and most of you are [scared to check your portfolios](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2omjca/) because the "everything bubble" finally [met a needle](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2t6vix/). 

**SLV/GLD:** Our "metal motherfuckers" got absolutely [warshed](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2oaqgt/) this week. Silver took its [largest single-day drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2ngblh/) in history, leaving retail as the [unwilling exit liquidity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2njb1d/). While the CME "helped" by [jacking margins](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2t434p/) to rub salt in the wounds, the real ones know if you can’t [hold it in your hands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsh6sp/chinas_gold_fever_sparks_us1_billion_scandal_as/o2vni7b/), it was never yours to begin with.

**TSLA:** Elon’s [favorite meme stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vq21j/) is officially pivoting away from cars because [BYD whooped its ass](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vq1jt/). Between the [Optimus robots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vrsj5/) that don’t do real work and those awkward [Epstein island](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2oh1l3/) emails, investors are starting to wonder if the company is just a [dude in a spandex suit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vrs5t/) dancing on the grave of your 401k.

**MSTR:** Michael Saylor is officially [underwater](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/01/31/michael-saylor-s-bitcoin-stack-is-officially-underwater-but-here-s-why-he-likely-won-t-reach-for-the-panic-button) on his BTC stack. Turns out, [massively diluting shareholders](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uwvhd/) to go all-in on a volatile asset might not be "prudent investing." The crypto bros are in [crisis mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uxiyh/), and we’re just waiting for the [margin calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uxlr6/) to complete the loss porn.

**RDDT:** The only green in this sea of red is the very platform you're using to go broke. Regards are betting the farm on [RDDT calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mtbca/) for earnings. With continued [user growth](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2ocpoc/), some think it could [easily hit $200](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2ocpoc/) this week. If it misses, Hindsight Capital has a reserved spot for the CEO in the [hall of shame](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2n3mfc/).

**SNDK:** For those who still have a [Wendy’s budget](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v1ab1/), SanDisk is the "best pure momentum play" right now. It has a [tiny float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v1ab1/) and analysts are hallucinating targets as high as [$1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v8gjb/). It’s [moving without hype](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v3g8d/)—which in this market, usually means the rug pull is scheduled for Tuesday.

**ORCL:** Oracle is [liquidating its business](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2q3iux/) to fund a $156B OpenAI deal because they are [dangerously in debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxy48/). Cutting [30,000 jobs](https://hitconsultant.net/2026/01/30/tech-business-oracle-layoffs-cerner-sale-openai-financing-crisis/) just to buy a seat at Sam Altman’s table is the ultimate "one of us" move. 

If you’re feeling suicidal about your portfolio, remember: you only lost [three weeks of gains](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrya39/sorry_i_crashed_the_silver_market/o2rke7t/). Some of us have lost [three years](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrya39/sorry_i_crashed_the_silver_market/o2s6vrr/). If your "shiny stones" tanked, at least you can [stare at them](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2ocfjo/) while you wait for the heat to be turned off.

Stay regarded,
