Greetings, Future Food-Service Professionals,

Welcome to the upside-down. The Dow hit 50,000, yet the general sentiment is that we’ve been [cucked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r29e3j/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_12_2026/o4v81qs/) by black magic fuckery. While the government claims we added [one borjillion jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1vii7/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_11_2026/o4sjvvo/), the street is convinced the numbers are as [real as our unrealized gains](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1xly9/us_added_130000_jobs_in_january_beating/o4spgul/). We are currently navigating a market where "good news" is a [dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1vii7/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_11_2026/o4sd4yo/) and "bad news" is also a dump, leaving most of us [interviewing four times for a $30/hour gig](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r29e3j/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_12_2026/o4vajx9/) just to fund our next 0DTE fix.

**HOOD:** The ultimate bipolar play. We’ve got [bagholders](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4oco5v/) at $120 screaming for a moon mission while others realize they’re just [NPCs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r27425/casino_broken_back_to_the_hood/o4uqh7y/) in Vlad’s world. The calls are [fooked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1vii7/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_11_2026/o4shisy/), but the true degenerates are [buying more](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r24rkg/hood/o4uis15/) anyway.

**NBIS:** One regard is [naked and sleep deprived](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r29zli/nbis_full_port_leaps/) at a library computer after liquidating his laptop for leaps. It’s either a [lambo or a Wendy’s shift](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r29zli/nbis_full_port_leaps/), mostly because they have a ["white Jewish Russian/Israeli CEO"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r29zli/nbis_full_port_leaps/) who actually knows how to build AI infrastructure.

**SHOP:** A comedic [five-day chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1w1f1/shopify_10_premarket_after_q4_eps_057_vs_051/o4ug4ht/). After surging 12% pre-market on a beat, it [dumped 7%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1w1f1/shopify_10_premarket_after_q4_eps_057_vs_051/o4t4uos/) because reasons. Shoutout to the retard who [accidentally bought it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1w1f1/shopify_10_premarket_after_q4_eps_057_vs_051/o4si36i/) while trying to buy Spotify.

**MSFT:** Betting big on [vibes and work-meeting YOLOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r21shn/32k_msft_yolo_405_calls_expiring_march_6th/o4tlks7/). Despite being "safe," it’s currently a [world of pain](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r25yxq/100k_msft_calls/o4uy9w1/) for anyone with short-dated calls as the market develops an irrational fear that [AI will kill software](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r25yxq/100k_msft_calls/o4us6aj/).

**TSLA:** The [og of meme stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r20bn4/quarter_mil_loss_on_tesla/o4uvx1v/). One guy lost a [quarter-mil on puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r20bn4/quarter_mil_loss_on_tesla/o4t9udu/) because he forgot that [irrationality outlasts solvency](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r20bn4/quarter_mil_loss_on_tesla/o4tpaio/). Musk is apparently building [satellite factories on the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r20bn4/quarter_mil_loss_on_tesla/o4tfb5e/) now.

**FORD:** Reported an [8.2 billion dollar loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1pald/auto_giant_ford_reported_its_worst_quarterly/o4r5d6n/), yet the stock [didn't drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1pald/auto_giant_ford_reported_its_worst_quarterly/o4r8n6s/). Apparently, charging [100k for trucks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1pald/auto_giant_ford_reported_its_worst_quarterly/o4r7s10/) no one can afford is a bold strategy Cotton, let’s see if it pays off.

**ROOT:** The [dip that keeps on dipping](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r22o41/at_least_i_didnt_play_with_options/o4tvo3a/). One hero lost $300k on this [dogshit AI insurance company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r22o41/at_least_i_didnt_play_with_options/o4tt68m/) without even using leverage. Pure, unadulterated talent.

**THC:** In a ["task failed successfully"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r26uka/i_knew_marijuana_stocks_were_gonna_rip_huge_gain/o4uwepc/) moment, a regard bought Tenet Healthcare thinking it was a [marijuana stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r26uka/i_knew_marijuana_stocks_were_gonna_rip_huge_gain/o4uxdv7/) and walked away with a 5-bagger. God truly protects idiots.

**MRNA:** Cramer called it one of the ["hottest stocks,"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-moderna-one-hottest-160111408.html) so naturally the FDA [refused to review](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1il0v/moderna_says_fda_refuses_to_review_its/o4pt1fp/) their flu shot. The [inverse Cramer](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1il0v/moderna_says_fda_refuses_to_review_its/o4qg8fk/) continues to be the only reliable technical indicator.

**MCD:** Beat earnings because they realized people will pay [luxury prices for dumpster food](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2a0g4/mcdonalds_earnings_beat_estimates_as_chains_value/o4vmayi/). Drive-thrus are [packed with idiots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2a0g4/mcdonalds_earnings_beat_estimates_as_chains_value/o4vteio/) waiting 30 minutes to pay $10 for a Big Mac meal that should cost $3.

**MU / SNDK:** The [memory storage dip-buy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2bp02/buy_the_dip_on_any_memory_stock_mu_sndk_stx_and/o4vq4is/) is on. Some believe it’s a [1000% trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2bp02/buy_the_dip_on_any_memory_stock_mu_sndk_stx_and/o4vqj1b/) by end of year, while others think it's just a [topping process](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r2bp02/buy_the_dip_on_any_memory_stock_mu_sndk_stx_and/o4w6atw/).

**UPST:** Bullish institutional flows and a [CTO buying the dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4bhsbv/) have some loading calls, though the [fear of earnings dumps](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4o5cci/) remains high.

If you’re still holding, I suggest [water soup](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1vii7/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_11_2026/o4tw0hp/) for dinner. For financial reasons, we will be [passing away](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1vii7/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_11_2026/o4u1uak/).

In debt we trust,
