Greetings, you beautiful, soon-to-be-homeless degenerates,

It’s been an [exceptional shake out week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3z14ki/) that managed to [age us all ten years](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3yxqfs/) in five trading days. While the [DOW hits all-time highs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3yw3d8/), retail traders are being [decimated](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3yw3d8/) in a market that makes [less sense every week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3ywx2h/). We are staring down a week of [boring as fuck earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3y7gon/), where the only thing being [flushed](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qwuo98/getting_flushed/o3rppo6/) faster than the 🌽 is your retirement fund.

**[HIMS]:** The FDA decided to [finish HIMS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxvqfc/fda_intends_to_take_action_against_nonfdaapproved/o40u6ik/) by cracking down on [copycat GLP-1s](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxvoc5/hims_hers_health_12_after_hours_after_fda_moves/o3zbck7/). Apparently, not even their [dick pills](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxvoc5/hims_hers_health_12_after_hours_after_fda_moves/o3zbr87/) could give the stock a boner after-hours, as it [plummets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxvoc5/hims_hers_health_12_after_hours_after_fda_moves/o43o4dg/) on news of a [DOJ referral](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxvoc5/hims_hers_health_12_after_hours_after_fda_moves/o43r4gq/).

**[RDDT]:** Welcome to [Redardit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxt56j/rddt/o3z3d0g/), the only stock where [blowout earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxt56j/rddt/o3z6b9g/) lead to a [total sell-off](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxt56j/rddt/o3z2xl1/). We have legends out here [losing on shares, calls, and puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxt56j/rddt/o3ywdsu/) simultaneously. It's a [triple play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxt56j/rddt/o3z6mvw/) of failure.

**[MSTR]:** Up 26% after a [$12B loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3yxo2g/). Michael Saylor is basically running a [$1.25 trillion hall of mirrors](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxcj5p/inside_elon_musks_125_trillion_ai_and_space/o3vevi6/) while investors [buy the top](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o43ehph/) like there's no tomorrow.

**[TSLA]:** Elon is back to his [empty promises](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxcj5p/inside_elon_musks_125_trillion_ai_and_space/o3wblf6/) with a [megamerger](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxcj5p/inside_elon_musks_125_trillion_ai_and_space/o3wfobh/) involving SpaceX and xAI. Despite being [vaporware and ketamine-fueled dreams](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxcj5p/inside_elon_musks_125_trillion_ai_and_space/o3w5sp8/), the consensus is [calls it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxcj5p/inside_elon_musks_125_trillion_ai_and_space/o3veefr/).

**[QQQ]:** One brave [regard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyfyqz/well_boys_and_girls_im_back_with_another_crazy/o439md6/) turned $300 into $16,000 and [full ported into Monday calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyfyqz/well_boys_and_girls_im_back_with_another_crazy/o43cgq3/). He’s ready to meet the [theta monster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyfyqz/well_boys_and_girls_im_back_with_another_crazy/o43v0q9/) at the [open](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qyfyqz/well_boys_and_girls_im_back_with_another_crazy/o43gswl/).

**[NBIS]:** The [AI savior](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xkdgw/) that everyone is [praying](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o413sdt/) will save their portfolios. Its [1-year chart is insane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxqj73/been_nothing_but_green_all_week/o3y9ewt/), which obviously means it's [sustainable](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxqj73/been_nothing_but_green_all_week/o3ykpxl/).

**[HOOD]:** Bears are buying [puts on HOOD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xjhiy/) while bulls think it's [set up for a rally](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3yx4dl/). It's the ultimate [casino showdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qy5kvm/major_loss/o42609c/).

**[WEN]:** Mentioned more than [CPI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3yjgfk/), specifically for those of us [polishing our applications](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3z6shz/) to work behind the [dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxsn2j/thought_this_was_free_money_now_a_rddt_holder/o3ypyve/).

**[SLV]:** The [silver train](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qy29jx/hopped_on_the_silver_train/o40npfp/) is picking up steam, though trading it feels like [throwing darts with a blindfold](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qy29jx/hopped_on_the_silver_train/o414593/) on due to [massive IV](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qy29jx/hopped_on_the_silver_train/o43wflz/).

**[GDRX]:** Apparently a [front for TrumpRx](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxgldf/trumprx_is_a_front_for_gdrx_but_nobody_cares/o3w4u0t/), leading to degenerate strategies like [ASS TO MOUTH calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxgldf/trumprx_is_a_front_for_gdrx_but_nobody_cares/o3w95bh/).

**[APP]:** A few users made [six figures](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xeb0o/) last year, but now they're worried the [market won't care](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xeb0o/) about their report.

**[SHOP]:** Everyone is wondering if it can [tank anymore](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3y55gd/) or if it’s just a [black hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xo8vi/) for boomer capital.

**[BULL]:** Investors are [panic rotating](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qy5kvm/major_loss/o41ruvs/) or [holding for recovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qy5kvm/major_loss/o42xzc1/), despite the fact that [sentiment is negative](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qy5kvm/major_loss/o42k8cj/).

In conclusion, [bears sound smart, but bulls make money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3z4v9o/). Go [touch some grass](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxtp2q/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o3yzgjt/) or smoke it—just stay away from the charts until Monday resets your misery.

May your calls be ITM and your wife's boyfriend be generous,
