Patrons of the Wendy’s Dumpster and Hindsight Global Investors,

Today’s market vibe is a delightful cocktail of paranoia and poverty. While the [Daily Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0yvpa/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_10_2026/) suggests SPY will hover in this range [until the end of time](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0yvpa/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_10_2026/o4ltnwx/), the [Weekly Earnings Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/) has officially become a graveyard for anyone who thought Robinhood calls were a retirement plan. Between [fake job numbers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1898s/two_federal_reserve_members_say_the_jobs_numbers/) and [consumer delinquencies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-10/us-consumer-delinquencies-jump-to-highest-in-almost-a-decade?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MDc0MTc4MywiZXhwIjoxNzcxMzQ2NTgzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQThZQUVUOU5KTFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI3RDlGNUI3NEJDNzI0NDNFOTUwODNCODNFNzUzREUwQyJ9.Du3BR96lQW0L2KWhg5oRu1Rh_WPLoezMpeV1nz6HKug) hitting decade highs, the only thing being "distributed" today is the collective dignity of retail traders.

**[HOOD]:** Total carnage. Despite an EPS beat, the revenue miss sent the stock into a [Clifford-style cliff dive](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1da70/robinhood_hood_just_reported_earnings/o4opnns/). Thousands of "investors" are currently [uniting as bagholders](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1cydf/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_11_2026/o4ovfj4/), discovering that buying calls on the app that robs from the poor is a [one-way ticket back to the actual hood](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1da70/robinhood_hood_just_reported_earnings/o4p351o/).

**[SPOT]:** A rare [shining beacon of hope](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r13t5n/glorious_lol/). While the rest of the market burns, Spotify bulls are busy [booking gains](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r13t5n/glorious_lol/o4mna56/) and [ignoring boycotts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r11hz2/spotify_15_premarket_after_q4_2025_revenue_536b/o4mdpnw/). Apparently, the world is willing to pay higher premium fees just to drown out the sound of their portfolios collapsing.

**[TSLA]:** One absolute madman is sitting on [$600,000 in short-dated puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0i9on/600000_in_short_dated_tsla_puts/o4idhbn/), betting that the Muskrat’s [sexbots or moon missions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0i9on/600000_in_short_dated_tsla_puts/o4iogy9/) won't save the stock. It’s a bold strategy to [short a cult](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0i9on/600000_in_short_dated_tsla_puts/o4ilzwc/), but as we say here, God gives the most to his [favorite retards](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0i9on/600000_in_short_dated_tsla_puts/o4ihhjg/).

**[GOOGL]:** Alphabet is out here selling [100-year debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0c6du/google_is_selling_100_year_debt/o4h4mbw/) like they’re a sovereign nation. Investors are effectively being asked to [baghold for a century](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0c6du/google_is_selling_100_year_debt/o4h90jn/) in British Pounds. It’s [generational debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0c6du/google_is_selling_100_year_debt/o4ksh7z/), so your grandchildren can also experience the joy of a red screen.

**[IWM]:** Small caps are being [sniped by put-buyers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1898s/two_federal_reserve_members_say_the_jobs_numbers/o4np228/) ahead of the government’s scheduled [jobs data "revision."](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1898s/two_federal_reserve_members_say_the_jobs_numbers/o4nlvgg/) When J-Pow says the numbers are [overstated by 60k a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1898s/two_federal_reserve_members_say_the_jobs_numbers/), you know the rug is being freshly vacuumed.

**[S]:** SentinelOne is currently the [all-in conviction play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0reg9/s_priced_like_its_going_bankrupt_im_all_in/o4k9d5h/) for people who believe "priced like it's going bankrupt" is a bullish signal. Whether it's the [Kmart of cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0reg9/s_priced_like_its_going_bankrupt_im_all_in/o4kfvjt/) or an oversold gem is irrelevant—it's [100% of a portfolio now](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0reg9/s_priced_like_its_going_bankrupt_im_all_in/o4kavri/).

**[OSCR]:** Oscar Health dropped a [double miss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r10rt5/oscar_health_oscr_earnings_are_out_eps_124_est/o4m17n9/), but raised guidance so hard it smells like [dogshit wrapped in a future scandal](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r10rt5/oscar_health_oscr_earnings_are_out_eps_124_est/o4m1q0d/). Apparently, being [backed by the Kushners](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r10rt5/oscar_health_oscr_earnings_are_out_eps_124_est/o4mko6a/) wasn’t enough to "goose" the stock this time.

**[CME]:** Launching [single stock futures](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1ayp8/cme_group_to_launch_single_stock_futures_this/o4o6rif/) this summer. Finally, a way to [lose money 24/5](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1ayp8/cme_group_to_launch_single_stock_futures_this/o4ohqsp/) without those pesky weekend breaks for mental health.

**[AMZN]:** Divided sentiment. Some say [buy the dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0j22h/buy_the_dip_amzn/o4ijcm1/), others say it's on a [slow path to death](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0j22h/buy_the_dip_amzn/o4l716t/) because their warehouse robots are on the verge of a [violent strike](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0j22h/buy_the_dip_amzn/o4ikno6/).

**[AGQ]:** One grown man just got [nuked for $35,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r141wd/grown_man_loss_porn_silver_train_smashed_me_good/o4mp4mc/) trying to short the silver train. It turns out [0 strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r141wd/grown_man_loss_porn_silver_train_smashed_me_good/o4mvu15/) and silver-shorting don't mix well when the world is ending.

**[GRANITESHARES]:** Filed for [30 new 4x leveraged ETFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0lr5s/graniteshares_has_filed_30_new_4x_leveraged/o4j3itz/). Because 3x leverage was too slow for the current generation of [loss-chasers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0lr5s/graniteshares_has_filed_30_new_4x_leveraged/o4j6stn/). It’s basically [selling crack](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0lr5s/graniteshares_has_filed_30_new_4x_leveraged/o4jnhab/) in ticker form.

**[OPEN]:** Opendoor remains the source of [maximum frustration](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4hricl/) due to a [calendar error](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4ieatu/). Traders bought calls for the wrong week, proving that literacy is still the greatest barrier to wealth in this sub.

**[FERRARI]:** One degenerate is [sipping Mexican Coke](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3zrdc9/) and dreaming of a Ferrari, while the rest of us are [updating our resumes at Wendy's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xih3n/).

If the job data is fake, the inflation is high, and the consumer is delinquent, logic says we should pump. [Inverse the obvious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r1898s/two_federal_reserve_members_say_the_jobs_numbers/o4nocfw/), or just accept that we’re all [playing a game we don’t understand](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0yvpa/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_10_2026/o4mq4iz/).

Stay regarded,
