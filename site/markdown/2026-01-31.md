Listen up, you beautiful, degenerate bagholders,

The market currently has the structural integrity of a [wet paper towel](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2obayd/), and our collective portfolios look like a crime scene. The general vibe is "everything pukes" as the era of the "Warsh Trade" begins. While we were all busy dreaming of lambos, the market decided to move like a [piece of shit meme coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2obayd/). If you aren't currently staring at your brokerage app in a catatonic state, you probably aren't [highly regarded](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrlpae/just_saw_my_degenerate_gambling_returns_vs_sp500/o2p519m/) enough to be an investor here.

**SLV/GLD (Silver & Gold):** The "safe haven" play just turned into a [historic slaughterhouse](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qre0t9). Silver fell 38% from its record high, making it the largest single-day drop in history. Between the [CME jacking up margins](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2t434p/) like a predatory landlord and JPM’s former quant [calling the top](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrd08w/redhot_silver_is_almost_guaranteed_to_plunge_50/o2n8a77/) with suspicious precision, retail got used as [exit liquidity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2njb1d/) once again. Some of you are now [long-term investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrjkqp/a_beautiful_80k_loss/o2ophzf/) (read: bagholders) for the next 14 years.

**RDDT (Reddit):** Earnings are coming, and the bulls are [fucking sending it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mp0c5/). Despite the earnings thread graphic having [280p resolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qd0ee/), the sentiment is clear: people are betting on user growth to [moon the stock back to $200](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2ocpoc/). It’s a bold move for a company whose main product is providing a platform for us to [post our loss porn](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2omjca/).

**SPAX.PVT (SpaceX):** Elon is reportedly [printing $8B in profit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2ubekh/) and targeting a $1.5T valuation for a June IPO. Some of you think this is a [value play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2ubgt3/) compared to Tesla, while the skeptics think the [books are being cooked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2ub0vo/) faster than a Falcon 9 on re-entry. Either way, someone is going to [lose a limb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2u8mmq/) playing the IPO.

**ORCL (Oracle):** Big Blue is [cutting 30k jobs](https://hitconsultant.net/2026/01/30/tech-business-oracle-layoffs-cerner-sale-openai-financing-crisis/) and selling Cerner just to fund a $156B OpenAI deal that Nvidia is currently [leaving on ice](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-100-billion-megadeal-between-openai-and-nvidia-is-on-ice-aa3025e3). Investors are wondering if [Sam Altman has Epstein-level dirt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2q2ysa/) on tech CEOs to keep these non-profitable deals alive. If this Jenga tower falls, [we’re all cooked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxzbb/).

**PYPL (PayPal):** One absolute madman is [selling $2.6M worth of puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs38rj/paypal_earnings_play_pypl/o2sh5il/) on an "undervalued" stock that hasn't moved in four years. It’s a classic case of [catching a falling knife](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs38rj/paypal_earnings_play_pypl/o2sit8t/). Either he buys a yacht or he'll be [flipping burgers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrnpms/how_do_i_get_a_refund/o2nocpm/) at the Wendy's dumpster with the rest of the silver bulls by Tuesday.

**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile):** A rare win in a sea of red. One guy turned a [Hail Mary into a 30x gain](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qrqgd4) with puts, proving that even a blind squirrel finds a nut if it [apes hard enough](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrqgd4/30x_with_asts_hail_mary/o2q3se9/).

If your portfolio is currently hemorrhaging, don't worry—you only lose if you sell, or if the [CME margin called you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2t434p/) into oblivion already. Remember, stop limits are for people who value their [wife's boyfriend's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrjkqp/a_beautiful_80k_loss/o2op3q6/) approval. 

Stay regarded,
