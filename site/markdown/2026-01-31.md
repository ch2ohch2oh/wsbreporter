Fellow Exit Liquidity and Soon-to-be Wendy’s Associates,

The market currently has the structural integrity of a [Jenga tower](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxzbb/), and we’re all playing with oven mitts. We just watched a 40-trillion-dollar market [move like a piece of shit meme coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2obayd/), mostly because someone [nominated a hawkish Fed Chair](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2nhexe/) who thinks Bitcoin is "innovative." While half the sub is [scared to check their portfolios](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2omjca/), the other half is busy betting the farm on [shitty resolution graphics](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mpypy/) and companies that have [hostages instead of customers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsixft/msft_has_underperformed_the_sp_500_in_the_past_5/o2w2fik/). It’s officially [puts season](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mtbca/).

**[SLV/GLD]:** A total historic puke. Silver dropped 38% in a day, an event unseen since we were [little sperms in our dads' ballsacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2ogj4z/). CME jacked margins [right after the puke candle](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2t434p/), and now the 3x leveraged funds are [not going to recover](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrya39/sorry_i_crashed_the_silver_market/o2ruq4z/). Apparently, "safe havens" involve [Chinese trading scams](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs651t/gold_trading_platform_of_collapsing_after_users/o2t7wfm/) and [paper gold](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs651t/gold_trading_platform_of_collapsing_after_users/o2t7wfm/) scams.

**[RDDT]:** Degenerates are [full porting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2svqu8/) ahead of earnings. The bulls think it’s [too good to pass up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mtbca/) and could easily hit [$200 again](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2ocpoc/) next week if user growth doesn’t suck as much as the [ugly earnings graphics](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mpypy/). 

**[MSTR]:** Michael Saylor is officially [underwater on his BTC stack](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2v0kn4/), and the crypto bros are in [crisis mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uxiyh/). Turns out [massively diluting shareholders](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uwvhd/) to go all-in on a volatile asset isn't "prudent investing"—it’s just a [Ponzi scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qseje0/microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_its_bitcoin/o2uxi32/) with better memes.

**[TSLA]:** Elon is the [greatest con artist in history](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vplr9/), pivoting to robots because [car sales flopped](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2w1f1a/). While the cult is all-in on humanoid robots, the bears remind us that their last bot was just a [dude dancing in a spandex suit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsi5iz/tesla_just_made_it_clear_its_no_longer_a_car/o2vrs5t/).

**[SNDK]:** The [best pure momentum play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v17qe/) right now. With a tiny float and [analyst targets at $1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v8gjb/), it’s moving [violently without hype](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v3vh7/). Of course, half the sub thinks it's [overpriced](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsf4y4/after_blowout_earnings_why_sndk_sandisk_is_the/o2v2l5a/) and ready for a rug pull.

**[GFS]:** This stock is [shorted to the gills](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbnav/globalfoundries_gfs_has_10125_institutional/o2vrkx0/). Someone [loaded the f’king boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbnav/globalfoundries_gfs_has_10125_institutional/o2u9te5/) on quad-witching volume, and the theory is that [NVDA might buy a stake](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbnav/globalfoundries_gfs_has_10125_institutional/o2u9te5/) to scale robotics. Even if the tech is [outdated](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbnav/globalfoundries_gfs_has_10125_institutional/o2uowfl/), the [SRAM heavy AI chips](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbnav/globalfoundries_gfs_has_10125_institutional/o2udhjb/) have bulls feeling "shit-tastic."

If your portfolio is currently hemorrhaging, remember: at least you can [stare at your shiny stones](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2ocfjo/) while your purchasing power vanishes. If everything goes to zero, I’ll see you at the [Wendy’s dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsd887/all_right_you_perverts/o2vcgvv/). And don't bother asking for a refund; [stop limits are for pussies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrnpms/how_do_i_get_a_refund/o2pt37y/).

May your losses be tax-deductible,
