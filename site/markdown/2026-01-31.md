Greetings, fellow Bagholders and Future Wendy’s Associates,

If you’re reading this, congratulations on surviving the largest single-day puke in precious metals history. The market mood has officially shifted from "to the moon" to "please [save me](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2omjca/)." Between the new Fed nominee Kevin Warsh sending the dollar on a revenge tour and the AI bubble showing structural cracks, our "buy high, sell low" strategy is performing exactly as expected. While the SPY is only down a fraction, our portfolio of [retard stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2obvic/) is in absolute shambles. Grab a crayon and let’s dive into the wreckage.

**SLV / GLD:** The "safe havens" decided to act like [pump dot fun tokens](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2ngh2b/) this week. Silver suffered a historic 38% crash, proving that the only thing "precious" about these metals is the [loss porn](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrjkqp/a_beautiful_80k_loss/o2onxxw/) they generated. While some geniuses hit [50-bagger puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2nifsp/), most of you were busy [buying the top](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2njs9b/) because a coworker mentioned it. Now that the CME [jacked margins](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2t434p/), we’re officially long-term investors (bagholders).

**RDDT:** Investors are preparing to bet the farm on our favorite digital dumpster fire. With earnings around the corner, the consensus is to [fucking send it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mp0c5/) on calls. Some bulls think it’s heading back to [$200 next week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2ocpoc/), while others are just [full porting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2svqu8/) and praying the user growth doesn't disappoint. If this fails, at least we can all complain about it in the same thread we lost our money in.

**ORCL:** Oracle is currently in a "financing crisis," reportedly planning to [fire 30,000 people](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxwcd/) and sell off Cerner just to pay for their OpenAI addiction. The hive mind is split: half think the stock will [rally on lower costs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pybc8/), while the smarter half realizes the [dominoes are starting to wobble](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2q0444/).

**SPACEX:** Elon’s space company is reportedly printing [$8 billion in profit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2u8td8/), leading to a staggering $1.5 trillion valuation rumor. While the fanboys are ready to [risk a limb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2u8mmq/) on the IPO, the bears are screaming about [cooked books](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2ub0vo/) and SpaceX paying themselves for Starlink launches. Either way, it’s a value play compared to Tesla’s PE, which is basically a phone number.

**PYPL:** PayPal is currently the [most hated stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs38rj/paypal_earnings_play_pypl/o2skat9/) on the market despite a forward PE of 9. One absolute unit [sold 500 puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs38rj/paypal_earnings_play_pypl/o2sh5il/), essentially betting $2.6 million that the bottom is in. Most of us are just watching from the sidelines, waiting for the inevitable "GUH" or the rally that finally justifies four years of [flat trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs38rj/paypal_earnings_play_pypl/o2si9fs/).

**ASTS:** While the rest of the market burned, one legend managed to [30x a Hail Mary](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrqgd4/30x_with_asts_hail_mary/o2q3se9/) on puts. It’s a classic case of [extreme luck](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrqgd4/30x_with_asts_hail_mary/o2q8uv2/) meeting a total market meltdown. It reminds us all that if you gamble long enough, eventually you’ll accidentally be right.

In conclusion, if your portfolio is currently hemorrhaging, just remember: you haven't lost anything until you sell, but you also won't have a roof over your head if you don't. Maybe try [blowing on the cartridge](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrjkqp/a_beautiful_80k_loss/o2oqdad/) or asking your broker for a [refund](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrnpms/how_do_i_get_a_refund/o2pj4oa/). If all else fails, I hear [ornamental gourds](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrd08w/redhot_silver_is_almost_guaranteed_to_plunge_50/o2nc1th/) are a prudent pivot.

Warmly (from the warmth of a burning trash can),
