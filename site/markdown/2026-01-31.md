Listen up, you beautiful, penniless bags of meat,

If you’re reading this, you probably still have an internet connection, which means you haven't yet pawned your router to cover the margin calls on your "safe haven" assets. The [weekend vibe](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2obdal/) is currently somewhere between a funeral and a riot at a Shenzhen gold distribution center. We’ve managed to turn a [40 trillion dollar market into a piece of shit meme coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2obayd/), and quite frankly, the smell of [burning portfolios](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2oc3dr/) is the only thing keeping me awake. Let’s dive into the wreckage.

**SLV/GLD:** The "boomer rocks" decided to identify as 0DTE options this week. Silver suffered its [largest single-day drop in history](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qre0t9/breaking_silver_crashes_38_from_record_high_gold/o2ngblh/), crashing 38% because apparently [JPMorgan's former quant chief](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrd08w/redhot_silver_is_almost_guaranteed_to_plunge_50/o2n8a77/) is a literal wizard. While the [CME jacked margins](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qs5xbo/cme_hikes_gold_margins_from_6_to_8_and_silver/o2t434p/) like a vengeful ex, our more [highly regarded investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrya39/sorry_i_crashed_the_silver_market/o2rke7t/) were busy losing years of gains in hours. If you’re holding physical, at least you can [stare at your shiny stones](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrhst1/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o2ocfjo/) while your wife's boyfriend explains why you're moving into the basement.

**KWAR (The Warsh Trade):** Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as Fed Chair, and the market reacted like it just saw a [ghost in the machine](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr3fde/donald_trump_nominates_kevin_warsh_as_federal/o2l6jc5/). Is he a hawk? Is he a [crypto-bro](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrb96n/here_is_the_person_who_was_just_nominated_to_be/o2muybk/)? Nobody knows, but he’s already [Warshed the nuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr49bf/gold_8_below_5000_and_silver_17_to_95_after_trump/o2liteg/) off the metals market. Some say he's here to [debase the dollar](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrb96n/here_is_the_person_who_was_just_nominated_to_be/o2nf7mo/) until your 401k is worth a gallon of milk; others are just [scared of his voice](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrb96n/here_is_the_person_who_was_just_nominated_to_be/o2n496p/).

**SPAX (SpaceX):** Elon is allegedly [printing $8 billion in profit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2ubekh/) on Starlink's back, but the [1.5 trillion valuation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2u8mmq/) for the IPO is making people's limbs tingle with phantom loss pain. While some argue the [books are cooked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2ubnh4/) because they don't count the cost of the rockets they blow up, the true degenerates are [all in on ASTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qsbfok/spacex_posts_8b_profit_on_1516b_revenue_in_2025/o2u9gnj/) as a "Hail Mary" to recover from their silver-induced poverty.

**ORCL:** Oracle is reportedly preparing to [yeet 30,000 employees](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxy48/) and sell Cerner at a loss just to pay for [Sam Altman’s AI addiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2q2ysa/). The sentiment is that the [entire US economy is a Jenga tower](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pxzbb/), and Oracle just pulled a bottom brick. But hey, [operating costs go down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrpe22/oracle_may_cut_30k_jobs_and_sell_cerner_to_fund/o2pybc8/), so stock go up, right? This is the way.

**RDDT:** It’s earnings week for our favorite echo chamber. People are betting the [farm on subscriptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2r42m1/) and user growth. Whether it [moons to $200](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2ocpoc/) or leaves investors with a [burned ass](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2qtoqc/) again, the [graphics on the earnings thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qr9ztv/weekly_earnings_thread_22_26/o2mpypy/) are still uglier than my last realized loss statement.

**TTWO/U:** Google released an AI model that turns prompts into "playable worlds," and video game investors reacted like [absolute morons](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrj5d6/videogame_stocks_slide_on_googles_ai_model_that/o2oln71/). It’s a [slow-moving slideshow](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrj5d6/videogame_stocks_slide_on_googles_ai_model_that/o2p1sf0/), but it was enough to send Take-Two sliding. The smart money (if that exists here) is [buying the dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrj5d6/videogame_stocks_slide_on_googles_ai_model_that/o2p5cks/) because GTA 6 isn't going to be coded by a chatbot anytime soon.

In conclusion: precious metals are fake, AI is a debt-fueled hallucination, and the only thing guaranteed is the [Wendy’s dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrjkqp/a_beautiful_80k_loss/o2ot2w1/) will be crowded this Monday. If you're looking for a "refund" on your trades, please [walk into your local bank](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrnpms/how_do_i_get_a_refund/o2pk7e2/) and ask for a manager.

Stay regarded,
