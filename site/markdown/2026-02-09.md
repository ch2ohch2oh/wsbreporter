To my fellow degenerate elite,

Welcome to another week of burning money to stay warm. The general market mood is a delightful cocktail of [“unemployeement”](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4aqau3/) anxiety and the realization that [SPY 700 is the ultimate bait](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0gc1u/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_10_2026/o4hzp24/) that gets us every damn time. While some of you are [filing taxes early](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0gc1u/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_10_2026/o4i0vlq/) out of sheer shame, others are preparing for a week of earnings that will either buy you a Ferrari or a [frosty at the midday midday reflection](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3zrdc9/).

**[HOOD]:** Massive bullish sentiment here as everyone thinks the stock is [beaten down way too much](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o44l966/). The consensus is that [any positive news](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3yx4dl/) will send this flying, though some are loading puts because [corn doesn’t know how to pump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xjhiy/).

**[HIMS]:** A total bloodbath after Novo Nordisk decided to [sue the copycats](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r03jth/novo_nordisk_suing_hims_over_copycat_versions_of/o4fce4p/). While some [tapped out at -30%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r03jth/novo_nordisk_suing_hims_over_copycat_versions_of/o4fqkg2/), one legendary gambler narrowly escaped a $500k position with a [$17k gain](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0gw61/500k_hims_yolo_gain_part_2/) after nearly having a heart attack.

**[TSLA]:** One absolute unit dropped [$600,000 in short-dated puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0i9on/600000_in_short_dated_tsla_puts/o4idhbn/) betting that the stock hits [oblivion](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0i9on/600000_in_short_dated_tsla_puts/o4idhbn/). Most think he’s [going to fund Elon’s child support](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0i9on/600000_in_short_dated_tsla_puts/o4ig3te/), but the bears are growling about it being a [$70 stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0i9on/600000_in_short_dated_tsla_puts/o4ig1v1/).

**[GOOG]:** Alphabet is selling [100-year debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0c6du/google_is_selling_100_year_debt/o4h90jn/) in British Pounds, leading to a new level of [generational bag holding](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0c6du/google_is_selling_100_year_debt/o4h90jn/). Our investors should note that [WW2 was less than 100 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0c6du/google_is_selling_100_year_debt/o4hdxh6/), so a lot can happen.

**[RDDT]:** Described as a [powder keg](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzjzun/rddt_is_a_powder_keg/), bulls are betting on AI data licensing deals, even if the training data is just [pedantic and autistic](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzjzun/rddt_is_a_powder_keg/o4bllnc/) shitposts.

**[NIKKEI]:** Japan has unlocked its [own stonk anime arc](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzqkfd/japans_nikkei_225_skyrockets_over_5_to_hit_record/o4crmoa/) with the Nikkei skyrocketing 5%. It’s a [carry trade party](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzqkfd/japans_nikkei_225_skyrockets_over_5_to_hit_record/o4cri79/) until someone gets nuked by the bond market.

**[OPEN]:** Total chaos regarding [earnings dates](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4hricl/), with some [expecting six figures](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3zrdc9/) and others certain it’s about to [tank hard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o3xh5gb/). 

**[MSFT]:** Investors are [full porting 30k](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r08hm9/msft_30k_yolo_440c_march6th_expiration/) into calls because they think it has [no business trading below 500](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r08hm9/msft_30k_yolo_440c_march6th_expiration/o4hcrkf/).

**[HAS]:** Magic the Gathering is [printing money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0evu7/magic_the_gathering_parent_hasbro_has_earnings/o4inan7/) and carrying the whole company on its back while the [autism Venn diagram](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0evu7/magic_the_gathering_parent_hasbro_has_earnings/o4hqfq1/) of the player base remains a perfect circle.

**[SPOT]:** The ultimate [loss porn journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzysc7/the_final_bell/o4eigxm/)—one regard is gambling his [last $1,000 ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzysc7/the_final_bell/) on Spotify calls before checking into a gambling recovery program.

**[PLTR]:** A lone bear is screaming [don’t trust the Monday rally](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/), targeting Palantir for a [beta-fisting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qz92yi/dont_trust_the_monday_rally/) by upcoming economic data.

**[XLE]:** Bullish energy calls are trending as the [next big move](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0fwnq/xle_is_the_next_silver/o4hzgq5/) in the commodities cycle, though some fear [retail is finally catching on](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0fwnq/xle_is_the_next_silver/o4hxy4k/).

**[AMZN]:** Critics call it a [shit stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0j22h/buy_the_dip_amzn/o4iwbb0/) that trades sideways, while others think it’s a [dip worth buying](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0j22h/buy_the_dip_amzn/o4ijcm1/) before the warehouse robots go on strike.

**[UPST]:** Bullish AF after the CTO made a [$3 million uninformed buy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qxmgeh/weekly_earnings_thread_29_213/o4bhsbv/) following the last earnings sell-off.

**[ACHR]:** Full ported into the [Nikola of the Skies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r0aneb/archer_yolo/o4gzptv/) because the graphic design department is apparently better than the engineering one.

The market can stay retarded longer than you can stay solvent, but as we always say, [90% of gamblers quit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qzysc7/the_final_bell/o4ehq5c/) right before their big break. Go get those fries in the bag.

See you at Wendy's,
