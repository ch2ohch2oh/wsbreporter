**Dearly Regarded Investors,**

Happy Valentine’s Day. While the rest of the world is wasting money on flowers, our community of degenerate scholars spent the week [neglecting their actual jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58fk1c/) to watch the market move sideways. The general vibe is a mix of [dark depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58huv4/) and absolute disbelief. Despite the government claiming [CPI is cooling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3paba/consumer_prices_rose_24_annually_in_january_less/o55tfrl/), the consensus is that the [books are cooked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3paba/consumer_prices_rose_24_annually_in_january_less/o55tvpq/) and your groceries are still priced like luxury goods. We’re currently trapped in a [Kangaroo market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3nca3/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_13_2026/o55hovi/) where the only thing guaranteed is that your [portfolio will crash](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4yoqj/70k_rebound_yolo/o5f611g/) the moment you click "buy."

**AMZN:** The retail giant has been [red for 9 days straight](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58da4y/). One legendary strategist bet the farm that it would go [up 8% in a single day](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35env/if_amzn_goes_up_8_tomorrow_this_will_be_worth_1/o51sxe2/); instead, he ended up [completely cooked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35env/if_amzn_goes_up_8_tomorrow_this_will_be_worth_1/o56jtw6/) and is likely currently updating his resume for [McDonald's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35env/if_amzn_goes_up_8_tomorrow_this_will_be_worth_1/o57vuq6/).

**WEN:** Our primary employment backup, Wendy's, is [closing 140 restaurants](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-13/wendy-s-sinks-on-weak-outlook-plan-to-shutter-us-restaurants?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=copy). While some fear they'll be [evicted from the dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/o58nsh0/), optimists believe the [dumpsters will remain](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/o58no5x/) even if the store dies. Apparently, the quality tanked ever since they switched to [shredded lettuce](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r42aqr/were_fucked/o58ykay/).

**NVDA:** We are [betting the GT3RS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4xvec/nvda_earnings_play/o5exhyo/) on Jensen Huang's earnings. The bull case? It's trading at a [historical discount](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4xvec/nvda_earnings_play/) compared to Walmart. If the Supreme Court kills the [tariffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4xvec/nvda_earnings_play/), we moon; if not, we start at Wendy’s on [March 20th](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4xvec/nvda_earnings_play/).

**SLV:** Silver is currently a [falling knife made of sterling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r41vb4/slv_options_after_a_drop_of_30_in_a_day/o58k85d/). One investor managed to lose a [brand new Mercedes S-Class](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r41vb4/slv_options_after_a_drop_of_30_in_a_day/o58is6p/) in 24 hours. Don't worry, he took out a [10k personal loan](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r41vb4/slv_options_after_a_drop_of_30_in_a_day/o5a4rb2/) to double down.

**GOOGL:** Consistently [red in February](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4y0m9/alphabet_always_red_in_february/o5eym1s/), which makes it a prime candidate for what we call a [vibesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40hto/my_thesis_was_that_googl_will_dip_below_300_to/o58j2zh/)—a thesis supported only by vibes and a [Rhesus monkey's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40hto/my_thesis_was_that_googl_will_dip_below_300_to/o58u5dy/) intuition.

**BTC:** Michael Saylor has achieved [pure retardium](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3jkk2/at_last_weve_found_it_pure_retardium/o54paan/) by suggesting that if you lose everything, you should just [get more money from the bank](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58khl8/) and [roll it forward](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3jkk2/at_last_weve_found_it_pure_retardium/o55n7l4/). It's the infinite money glitch we've been looking for.

**CVNA:** Every time a suburban dad [shorts Carvana](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r41xmk/too_scared_to_yolo_naked_puts_settled_for_175k/o59ksn1/), the world heals. One hero is [doing his job to tank it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o57wguf/) by selling them his absolute "rust bucket" WRX.

**HOOD:** Robinhood is currently [robbing the Hood](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4753g/robbing_hood/o5cupwk/). One investor is [down $155k](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4753g/robbing_hood/o59mkx5/) after being greedy while others were greedy. Truly a [baller strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4753g/robbing_hood/o5a5tfy/).

**VKTX:** We’re eyeing the weight loss space because, frankly, [visiting Pennsylvania](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4opul/vktx_is_vk2735_the_next_glp1_candidate_in_a_phase/o5docj2/) confirms the TAM is "enormous." It’s treating [fatty livers and the fatties themselves](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4opul/vktx_is_vk2735_the_next_glp1_candidate_in_a_phase/o5czkm2/).

**CRSR:** A [broke student](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3ro93/broke_student_makes_back_lifetime_market_losses/o56btbm/) actually made money on Corsair? [Ban this ant](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3ro93/broke_student_makes_back_lifetime_market_losses/o56eqq8/) before he realizes that [taking risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3ro93/broke_student_makes_back_lifetime_market_losses/o56xdcz/) is only fun when you're ruining your life with a real job.

**MSFT:** [0DTE calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4w5b1/from_2k_to_300_msft_odte_calls/o5ekbdz/) are the leading cause of stress-induced heart failure this week. Remember, it's not about the money, it's about the [debt collectors we meet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r35env/if_amzn_goes_up_8_tomorrow_this_will_be_worth_1/o51ukh5/) along the way.

**WMT:** Defensive boomer stocks are [inexplicably packed](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o597erj/). If Walmart grows revenue by 2%, the market will reward them with a [20% pop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o5dave0/) because logic is dead.

**MU:** One of the few tickers [actually moving](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3si7w/pretty_much_every_other_day_has_been_like_this/o58wycl/). If we can [keep this going for a year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3si7w/pretty_much_every_other_day_has_been_like_this/o56icrq/), we might actually quit our jobs—or at least upgrade our [hot dog water](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58fcxk/).

**ABXX:** We’re looking at [real-time collateral](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4n9hs/abaxx_technologies_real_time_collateral_of_real/o5cnhzw/) for the commodities supply chain. It’s a [billion-dollar company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4n9hs/abaxx_technologies_real_time_collateral_of_real/o5dmdj2/) without a million in revenue. In this market, that makes it a [S&P 500 candidate](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r4n9hs/abaxx_technologies_real_time_collateral_of_real/o5e9wvm/).

**SPY:** Currently a [Kangaroo rollercoaster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3nca3/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_13_2026/o55vw7l/) bouncing off 680. It’s [puts season](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3xxhx/weekly_earnings_thread_216_220/o57wguf/) for dogshit companies, but the [DOW is over 50,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58wuoc/), so apparently everything is fine.

The credit risk is [de minimis at this point](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r3jkk2/at_last_weve_found_it_pure_retardium/o54txq2/). If your portfolio drops to zero, just [refinance the debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58fsj9/) and [add water to your shampoo bottle](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1r40xn0/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/o58bya8/). Happy trading, you beautiful losers.

See you behind the dumpster,
